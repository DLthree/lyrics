He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"


State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...


Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see



I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl





You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you


I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know,
I didn't read,
Between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, 
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late
So you see,
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah
How can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh


Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh


Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't

Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful


It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me


She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
'Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my


I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart
I look around, 
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, 
Listened to the radio,
Waited for something to come along,
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,
And I wrote down our song

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
