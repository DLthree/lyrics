He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"


State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...


Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see



I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl





You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you


I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know,
I didn't read,
Between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, 
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late
So you see,
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah
How can I ever,
try to be better
Nobody ever, 
let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh


Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh


Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't

Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful


It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me


She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
'Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my


I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart
I look around, 
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, 
Listened to the radio,
Waited for something to come along,
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,
And I wrote down our song 


Drew looks at me

And she's got everything that I have to live without

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star

And I wrote down our song 


Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you


She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we’re invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes
And make you realise

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile


Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realised by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?


DJ:
''Hey, a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?''

Tim McGraw: 
''I have heard this song.''

DJ:
''Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?''

Tim:
''It was awesome. Uh, except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.''

DJ:
*laughs*

Tim:
''I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more... I don't know if it's true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.''

DJ:
''Why don't we find out? Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?''

Taylor:
''Oh it's definitely a compliment. Yeah.''

*laughs*

DJ:
''Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.''

Tim:
''Nice-''

Taylor:
''Nice to meet you.''

Tim:
''Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?''

Taylor:
''I'm doing great. How are you doing?''

Tim:
''I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record! It's doing great.''

Taylor:
''Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker. ''

*laughs*

DJ:
''Well-''

Taylor: 
''The funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.''

*laughs*

Tim:
''Well I'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya.''

DJ:
''So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked?''

Tim:
''No.''

DJ:
''You haven't met?''

Tim:
''No.''

Taylor:
''No, we've never talked or met or anything.''

Tim:
''I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.''

Taylor:
''Oh my God. They never gave that to me.''

Tim:
''They didn't? Okay well, there ya go. I did.''

*laughs*

DJ:
''So I-I''

Taylor:
''We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.''

Tim:
''Not at all.''

DJ:
''So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called "Tim McGraw" without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?''

Taylor:
''It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.''

Tim:
''Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-''

Taylor:
''Could you tell Faith that I said hello?''

Tim:
''I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.''

Taylor:
''Oh my gosh, she's awesome.''

Tim:
''I agree.''

DJ:
''This, this... tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?''

Taylor:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...

*laughs*

Taylor:
''I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.''

Tim:
''Now I feel old.''

Taylor:
''And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.''

Tim:
''Aww, thank you.''

Taylor:
''And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well that's your first single"''

*laughs*

Taylor:
''"And I'm like "well..."''

Tim:
''Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.''

*laughs*

Taylor:
''That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.''

Tim:
''Alright, great.''

*laughs*

Tim:
''Well congratulations 'cause it's your first single, first top ten hit and that's pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.''

Taylor:
''Awesome, it's been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?''

Tim:
''Um I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.''

*laughs*

Taylor:
''Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.''

Tim:
''Ya do? What would-''

Taylor:
''Yeah.''

Tim:
''What would their name be?''

Taylor:
''Uh, um I think Taylor something.''

Tim:
''Something like that yeah.''

Taylor:
''But-''

Tim:
''Well I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.''

Taylor: 
''Just consider it.''

DJ:
''Ah, well that's very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.''

Tim:
''Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.''

DJ:
''I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.''

Tim:
''Absolutely.''

DJ:
''Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.''

Taylor:
''It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you Tim.''

Tim:
''You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.''

Taylor:
''Bye'' 

Tim:
''Good luck out there.'' 

Taylor:
''Thanks''


Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

"Merry Christmas" - I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl under cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special

Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special


Please take down the mistleoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyon's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everynbody
That'll have to be something I just say this year

Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases whe I didn't 
Wonder how you are tonight


Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Halleluia!
Halleluia!
Halleluia!

Christ the savior is born


What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie
Tell me what you would find

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to 
All the things that we wish they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I'd think there was somethingwe all forgot
What would happenif presents all went away
Tell me what would you find

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something 
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There's gotta be more


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white



Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes
I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I cry
Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause I - I
I want to be everything you need
I want to be where...

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be you're everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes...beautiful eyes


It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me


Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see


State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...


Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you


Wish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something I just fell into
And it was over-rated,
But just look what I created,
I came out alive but i'm black and blue
But boy you ask me if I'm all right
Think about what I had to do, yeah

Wake up, smell the break-up
Fix my heart put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand

I'd be fine if you just walked by,
But you had to talk about why 
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby 
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to

Wake up, smell the break-up
Fix my heart put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand

And when you're home all alone at night
You still wonder why
You took everything i had away but
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up, smell the break-up
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an "I heart question mark" written on the back of my hand
Written on the back of my hand
An "I heart question mark" yeah written on the back of my hand


There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah

We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment, now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted, was to be wanted
Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen

La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la-la-la la la la la
La-la-la la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors


We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all so I thought that
I'd never see nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving? 
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me 
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
Shine, shine, shine

Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself


Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Try and catch me now oh-oh
It's too late, to catch me now


You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me


I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 
Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm 

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie 
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to

Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry



I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on 
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

And I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why, why, tell me why

I take a step back, and let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know


All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby, but I've figured you out
And you thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could have loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting  in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby 
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no



He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened, please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything 
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, ohh

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it, baby
You said forever and always, yeah



I'm five years old 
Its getting cold out, got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you 
I run and run, past the pumpkin patch, and the tractor rides 
Look now, the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know youre not scared of anything at all 
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I'm thirteen now 
And dont know how my friends could be so mean 
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop til I forgot all their names 

I dont know who I'm gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you 
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out hes better than I am 
I grew up in a pretty house 
And I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 

There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me 
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
And daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
Staying back and watching me shine 
And I didnt know if you knew so I'm taking this chance to say 
That I had the best day with you today


And it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I’ll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

So we’ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We’re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we’re faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don’t need this
But there’s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Do you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It’s a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah



I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face
Oh, I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted
I had time to think it over and all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all 
So jump then fall

Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here, baby
I'll show you, I'll show you you can

Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah



Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
I'm reachin out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
And when you're close I feel like coming undone.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're sayin that you'd be here anyway.
But you're untouchable burning brighter than the sun,
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night we could form this dream.
I wanna feel you by my side, standin next to me.
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

Oh, Oh. 
I'm caught up in you. 
Oh, Oh, Oh.

Untouchable burnin brighter than the sun,
And when you're close I feel like comin undone.
You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin out your name
You gotta, come on, come on, say that we'll be together,
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven.

I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
And I know all the steps, 
Up to your door
But, I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind
Talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up,
And sing you a song
But, I don't want to have to go that far
And I, I got you down
I know you by heart,
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself
Talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here,
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long,
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But, I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore



This is wrong but
I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar



In the heat of the fight
I walked away.
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay.
I said "This time I had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up.
'cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more!
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

Me and my stupid pride
Sittin' here alone.
Going through the photographs,
Staring at the phone.
I keep going back over
The things we both said.
And I remember the slammin' door,
And all the things that I misread.
Baby you know everything,
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to
Chase after me? Yeah,

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more!
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

And I scream out the window
"I can't even look at you, I don't need you!",
But I do, I do, I do...
"See, there's nothing you can say
To make right again, I mean it, I mean it!",
What I mean is:

I said "Leave" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles,
Screaming: "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain,
Come back for more
And don't you leave,
'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door.

With your face,
And your beautiful eyes,
And the conversation,
With the little white lies.
And the faded picture
Of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car
Up the stairs
And I broke-down cryin'
Was it worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess,
I need you

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart
I look around, 
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, 
Listened to the radio,
Waited for something to come along,
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,
And I wrote down our song 


Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see


It's strange to think,
The songs we used to sing,
The smiles,
The flowers,
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you,
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go,
Tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no,
Baby, and you might still have me



I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl





She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
'Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my


He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"


State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

Baby, burn...


We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart
I look around, 
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, 
Listened to the radio,
Waited for something to come along,
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door

When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know

The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,
And I wrote down our song 


You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me running but I
kind of know that I won't get far.

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
that you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make you feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile


I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don’t you?

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Oh, run away
La la, oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you’ll say "Let’s run away now
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn’t say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"


Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at Sorry!
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed
By me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad, empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known

Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known


You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end.


Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light

To you everything's funny
You've got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No, no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen there is just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
Getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up
Never grow up
Just never grow up


There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, have we met?
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing on the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaning to say
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
'Cause I don't think you do
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
Don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you can say sabotage


I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you'd seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
And everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful, running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on the tightrope
It's never too late to get back


You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And It's coming over you  like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there, watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time 
I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know
I know

I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Though I never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it


I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last


I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling?"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long, long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

And I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered


Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough, but this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough, but this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough, but this love is ours


Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Because nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
That before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I let you walk
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
Baby, what about the ending
I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now


Tall, dark, and Superman
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yeah

And you'll smile and say, how are you?
I'll say just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you
I'll love you forever

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark, and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday he'll take me away
And save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they said

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love struck, and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the car was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around, forever and ever
And I watched Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
When you come back down


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me running but I
kind of know that I won't get far.

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
that you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just strong enough to make you feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby
like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around
cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile


You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now


I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, 
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter!

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride, like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending 
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end.


You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again, got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them
I'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I'll bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now, 'cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough, but this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough, but this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough, but this love is ours


I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time


Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you want to go
They don't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think, she's an actress, woah
But she's better known
For things that she does on the mattress, woah
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
'Cause I don't think you do
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
Don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you can say sabotage


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don’t you?

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Oh, run away
La la, oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you’ll say "Let’s run away now
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn’t say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"


I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last


Now that he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there

Now that he's back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had in May

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had in May


Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips are sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you when she blows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's ferocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She's got Bette Davis eyes


Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me,
Back in your heart

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back, ohh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Ohh woah-oh

Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me,
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms


Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine

You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at Sorry!
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed
By me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad, empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known

Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known


There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, have we met?
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing on the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaning to say
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And It's coming over you  like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there, watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time 
I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know
I know

I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Though I never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it


I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling?"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live 
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long, long live
The walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined
Just for me and you

And I was screaming, long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live
All the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live
That look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day
We will be remembered


I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right


Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, 
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red,loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head,in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street 


Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (You were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble


I walked through the door with you
The air was cold, but something 'bout it felt like home
Somehow and I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in a car
Getting lost upstate

The autumn leaves falling down
Like pieces into place
And I can picture it
After all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And it might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause here we are again
On that little town street
You almost ran the red
'Cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on my counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid
With glasses in a twin size bed

And your mother's telling stories
'Bout you on the t-ball team
You tell me about your past
Thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause here we are again
In the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen
In the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up

Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

Hey, you called me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel
In the name of being honest

I'm a crumbled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly
It's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again
Where I loved you so
Back before you lost the one
Real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (''Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew.'')
Ah-ah, ah-ah

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey!

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
(I don't know about you)
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
(You don't know about me)
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing
(Dance like we're)
Like we're twenty-two, twenty-two (oh-woah-oh)
Twenty-two (dancing like)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), we won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two), you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you


I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

Whoa, we made quite a mess, baby
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you’re touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me


I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...''what?''

Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...''like, ever''

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh ''(yeah)''
Ooh ''(yeah)''
Ooh ''(yeah)''
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say "Never say never..."
 
''...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.''

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together


I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said "Okay, let's talk."

And I said "Stay, stay, stay.
I've been loving you,
For quite some time, time, time."
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
I love you because you have given me no choice

But to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time

All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you
For quite some time
No one else is gonna love me

When I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny

When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you
For quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny
When I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best
If we both stay

That's so fun!


[Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better.

[Both]
Right before your eyes,
I’m breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me.

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Both]
Right before your eyes,
I’m aching
Run fast, nowhere to hide,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I’m asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list.
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong,

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I say "It’s been you all along."

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time I let you in my door

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Both]
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time I’m asking you this

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I’m asking you this

[Taylor Swift]
Put my name at the top of your list

[Gary Lightbody]
Put my name at the top of your list

[Taylor Swift]
This is the last time I’m asking you why

[Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I’m asking you why

[Taylor Swift]
You broke my heart in the blink of an eye

[Gary Lightbody]
You break my heart

[Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this


I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made
And that was the first day

And, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you."
And for the first time I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story’s got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you


Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


New to town with a made-up name,
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they’ll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they tell you now
You’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now
You’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

And they’ll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You’re the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh

Yeah, they'll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You’re the lucky one

Can you tell me now
You’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh


'''Ed Sheeran'''
''We good to go?''

'''Taylor Swift'''
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now
I didn't before

And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

'''Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran'''
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed

'''Ed Sheeran'''
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you.

'''Taylor Swift'''
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like

'''Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran'''
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I know it since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

'''Taylor Swift'''
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you
Know you, know you

'''Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran'''
All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
I know it is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours

'''Taylor Swift'''
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know it is pouring rain

'''Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran'''
And everything has changed

'''Taylor Swift'''
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days I'll know your face
I know it since yesterday

'''Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran'''
Is everything has changed


I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I'm a Barbie on the boardwalk
Summer of '45
Picked me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen
And crazy, running wild, wild

Can't remember what song
It was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said "Look at you, worrying too much about,
Things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that away."

He was trying to skip rocks
On the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?


Took a deep breath in the mirror 
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do 
Turned the lock and put my headphones on 
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do 

Walked in expecting you'd be late 
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you 
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don't know how nice that is 
But I do 

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I’m funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again 

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you 
But I do 
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy 
But I do 

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again 

And we walk down the block to my car 
And I almost brought him up 
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that 
For the first time, what's past is past 

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again 
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again


You should have been there
Should have burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here." smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking

People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall

And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When ears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should have been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you."
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew.

You call me later
And say "I'm sorry I didn't make it."
And I say "I'm sorry, too."
And that was the moment I knew


You said it in a simple way
Four a.m., the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then you catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, "Don't get attached."
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate, beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can't put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in 
I don't wanna miss you like this 
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

In New York, be here
But you're in London
And I break down
This is not fair
That you're not around

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

I don't wanna miss you like this

Come back, be here
Come back, be here


Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her, but I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah, and you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
And I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure, you understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her


Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity is too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Two headlights shine
Through the sleepless night
And I will get you,
Will get you alone

Your name has echoed
Through my mind
And I just think you should,
Think you should know

That nothing safe is
Worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, 
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red,loving him was red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I've never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
But loving him was red, oh, red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head,in burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd ever known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you'd never met
'Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red we're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street 


I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right


Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said "Welcome to New York"
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
Beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped out bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want: boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
Beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York ''(New York)''
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love
It keeps you guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love
It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change
Anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me

''(Welcome to New York)''
New soundtrack, it's been waiting for you
''(Welcome to New York)''
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
''(Welcome to New York)''
So bright they never blind me

Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you've heard about me

So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless ''(oh)''
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over ''(over)''
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far ''(ooh)''
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been awhile since I have even heard from you
''(Heard from you)''

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, ooh
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm

I say I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl

He says what you heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I
I said I've been there too a few times

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt ''(tight little skirt)''
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style ''(we never go, we never go)''
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home

''(Out of style)''
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style


Looking at it now
It all seemed so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered ''(then discovered)''
The rest of the world is black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

''(Are we out of the woods?)''

Looking at it now
Last December ''(last December)''
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together ''(back together)''

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
On the night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided
We decided to move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinkin'
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

''(Are we out of the woods?)''

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
And you started crying, baby I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
But when the sun came up, you were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
I remember
Oh I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good


People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed

The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

''(Stay)'' Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

''(Stay)'' Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 

All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 

Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made

People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

''(Stay)'' Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

''(Stay)'' Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 

All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 

Let me remind you this was what you wanted
You're in the air
You were all I wanted
But not like this

Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was ''(stay)''

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

''(Stay)'' Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was ''(stay)''

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why you had to go and lock me out
While I let you in?

''(Stay)'' Hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was ''(stay)''

All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)'' 
All you had to do was ''(stay)''


I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmh-hmm
That's what people say, mmh-hmm

I go on too many dates ''(heh-heh)''
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, mmh-hmm
That's what people say, mmh-hmm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off ''(whoo)''

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off ''(whoo)''

I never miss a beat, ah
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmh-hmm
That's what they don't see, mmh-hmm

I'm dancin' on my own ''(dancin' on my own)''
I'll make the moves up as I go ''(moves up as I go)''
And that's what they don't know, mmh-hmm
That's what they don't know, mmh-hmm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off ''(whoo)''

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God"
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there
With the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate ''(haters gonna hate)''
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off ''(whoo)''

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break ''(mmm)''
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake ''(they fake, they fake, they fake)''

I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off ''(whoo)''


It's 2:00 AM, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Bet it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
I wish, I wish, I

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

I wish you would


‘Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
‘Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me?
where I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

‘Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
‘Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last

Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

‘Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
‘Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts

Mmm, if you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done

He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds"
I thought "heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down."

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, oh
Wildest dreams, oh

I say no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair
His clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, oh
Wildest dreams, oh

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I'll bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down ''(down)''
Someday when you leave me
I'll bet these memories
Follow you around ''(follow you around)''

Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
''(Just pretend, just pretend)''
Wildest dreams, oh
In your wildest dreams, oh

''(Even if just real in your)''
Wildest dreams, oh
In your wildest dreams, oh


Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say "Are you insane?"

Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would weep for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would weep for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it
Used to be, be, yeah, yeah
With pictures in frames
Of kisses on cheeks, cheeks

Tell her how you must've lost your mind, ooh
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl

And now you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would weep for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would weep for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah yeah

And you could know
That I don't want you to go

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would weep for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go
On and on, on and on and I will

Skies grow darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just
Gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
And wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggle through the night for someone new
And, yeah, I could go
On and on, on and on

Lantern burning
Flickered in the mind, only you
But you're still
Gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip
Oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love
This love, this love, this love, this love

You'll kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
You'll smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love
This love, this love, this love, this love


''(I, I, I, I)'' I
''(I, I, I, I)'' I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as they pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vulture circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand
And don't ever drop it, my love

Baby
I know places we won't be found
And they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places
We can hide, I know places

They take their shots, we're bulletproof
''(I know places)''
And you know for me it's always you
''(I know places)''
And you're dead at night, your eyes so grey
''(I know places)''
And I know for you it's always me
''(I know places)''

''(I, I, I, I)'' I
''(I, I, I, I)'' I


The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like
A wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turn black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
And the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away
All my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown
Together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think that I am finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean


Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open that night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh, didn't they tell us, "Don't rush into things?"
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind

Oh, darling, we found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland

I reach for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home

You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever ''(last forever)''

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better ''(never better)''

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better

In Wonderland


One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back

Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough

Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck

He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word

And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face

Pauses, then says
"You're my best friend."
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing
In a snow globe round and round
And he keeps the picture
Of you in his office downtown

And you understand now why they
Lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life
Tryin' to put it in words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love


We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom ''(ah)''

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We're too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
The lights and boys are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
And switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true ''(ah)''

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We're too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic ''(it's so romantic, ah)''

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We're too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

It's 2:00 AM, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Bet it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
I wish, I wish, I

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
I wish you would
''(I wish you would, I wish you would)''
I wish you would
I wish you would

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you've heard about me

So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless ''(oh)''
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over ''(over)''
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far ''(ooh)''
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


I've never gone with the wind
Just let it flow, let it take me
Where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
Then you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own, every sky was
Your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Crazier, Crazier


Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'­d want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless


Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make
Everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense
Till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale


I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...


Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings

In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

So here you are
Two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far

But turn around
Oh, they've surrounded you with a showdown
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't, yeah, you got something they don't
You just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night grows dark
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open


Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh) 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no" 
You never saw it coming 
Except when you started running 
And now you come undone (I, I, I) 

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees (eh, eh) 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen you colors fade 
Wish I could make it better 
Someday you won't remember, 
This pain you thought would last forever and ever 

There you stand, ten feet tall 
I will say, "I knew it all along" 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction 

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh) 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes 
They never saw it coming 
You hit the ground running 
And now you're on to something 
I, I, I say 

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on 
Put me right, threw me right when you put them front 
And in this perfect weather 
It's like we don't remember 
The rain we thought would last forever and ever 

There you stand, ten feet tall 
I will say, "I knew it all along" 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction 

There you stand, next to me 
All at once, the rest is history 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction 

I’ll be one of the many saying 
Look at you now, look at you now, now 
I’ll be one of the many saying 
You've made us proud, you’ve made us proud 

I’ll be one of the many saying 
Look at you now, look at you now, now 
I’ll be one of the many saying 
You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud 

And when they call your name 
And they put your picture in a frame 
You know that I’ll be there time and again 
'Cause I loved you when 

When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh 
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no" 
Now in this perfect weather 
It's like we don't remember 
The rain we thought would last forever and ever 
 
There you stand, ten feet tall 
I will say, "I knew it all along" 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction 

There you stand, next to me 
All at once, the rest is history 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction


'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And I don’t think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood

I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was on D like DOC, remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it’s so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don’t think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood

Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it’s so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And I don’t think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we’ve got bad blood

Band-aids don’t fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-aids don’t fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And I don’t think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done (look what you’ve done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And I don’t think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey 


Well she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there
Was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
Yeah, and if she had to die
Tryin-she had one little promise
She was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
And she could the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashin on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God it's so painful
Something that's so close
And still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
You take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl


I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes, looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing, before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, and even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home, when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
You wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room
And this hospital grey 
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet, trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me 
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back


Sometimes I wonder 
How its gonna feel 
Will my first love be true and real 
Will I be ready when 
My heart starts to fall 
What will I do when my love comes to call 

And my daddy tells me 
That I light up his world 
Everyday he says "Darlin, 
You're my best girl" 
He tried to teach me 
From the very start 
The meaning of love 
So nobody breaks my heart 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pourin' rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the boy? 
Am I ready for love? 
For love 

I know I'm not a little 
Girl anymore 
Cuz I'm feeling things 
I've never felt before 
Sweet sensations 
And anticipations 
Calling commotion 
To my emotions 

And I hear the words 
My daddy says to me 
He said "be true to yourself 
And keep your spirit free 
And love will find you 

One way or another 
Be good to yourself 
And be good to each other" 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pourin' rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for love? 

Its a run around the world 
And its moving so fast 
Though I wanna find 
A love thats gonna last 
A love so strong 
That it can withstand 
The weight of the world 
In the palm of its hand 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pourin' rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for this game? 
Am I ready for the kiss? 
Am i ready for the stars? 
Am I ready for the bliss? 
Am I ready for love?


American boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, american boy

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an american boy

I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever

But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you say

Do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever

Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

You would run around and lead me on forever
While I stay at home still thinking we're together
I wanted our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Baby don't you break my heart slow


You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growin' up not wearin' any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day
Growin' up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Cuz she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on


All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
This summer sings a lullaby
Of just me and my baby

On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
Just me and my baby

The world is spinning 'round
'Cause of just what I found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
Faking pictures in my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
The back road was a better way
For me and my baby

The closer that we get
Ooh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Both know what we found
So we turned that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, and be with my baby
Ooh, yeah and be with my baby


Emily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says "baby girl what's wrong with you?"
She says "please don't make me go back there again"

She said "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it"
So he drives down to
That principle's office and says

"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down
That sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way"

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said "he tried but
There's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears
She said "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said

"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear
You down
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away,
You weren't brought up that way"

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says "it's Officer Tate"
He said "sir, there's been an accident,
You better come down here right away,
A drunken driver missed an overpass,
And Emily, she's fading fast"
He says "God,I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day
They put her
Momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive,
Was that little girl's smile
So please don't take that away,
I won't be easy taking her today,
She wasn't brought up that way"

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes


Any day now
They're talking war
I can see the light
That's in your eyes
They're not talkin
A week or two
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase
And take a picture
From the wall
I always knew
This time would come
When I ask how long
You think
You're gonna be
You say
"Eh, this crazy world's
Come undone"

Summer's over
And leaves begin
To fall
And another winter's
On the way
I knew
I wasn't gonna take
This very well
But I'd give everything
To have you here today

Everyday now
They're talking war
I know
This time has been
Like it's never
Been before
We're not talking
About a week or two
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy

I drive around this town in a mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me
I don't need the real thing
That's just another thing for me to try to tame
I don't know if I could' it might just break me
I thought there for a little while every sunset
I'd be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me

Before I met him I was so safe and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie and crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads and I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while every sunset
I'd be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me

It was all a bit wonderful and strange
But I'll never look at a sunset the same
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
Sitting fishing by the riverbank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
That's the closest you'll see me 


He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow

Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee


Isn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car, 
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And  we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end

And we'll tell each other things, like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me, 
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and *?* like girls
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on you


You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it off for someone else
'Cause lovin him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see that he's not me and...

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
But now baby it's your move
All you've got to do
Is believe in love, just believe in us now...

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Just believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby....

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Come and fall into me
Baby fall into me


Here you come again
Just when I've begun
To get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart
'Round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about
To make it work without you

You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin'
How I came to doubt you
All you gotta do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again

All you gotta do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
Here I go
And here you come again


I think of you every single evening 
As I lay awake at night.
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say:

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy, 
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling, 
As we walk down by the drives.
Take my hand, take my breath away,
Cause you make me feel like flying!

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!

Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy, 
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby,
All I really wanna say is:

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy, 
Oh, except you, honey baby!


Guess mine is not the first heart broken,
My eyes are not the first to cry I'm not the first to know,
There's just no gettin' over you
Hello, I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around
And wait for you
But baby can't you see, there's nothin' else
For me to do I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide,
Since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you,
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying "fool, forget him",
My heart is saying "don't let go"
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide,
Since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you,
Hopelessly devoted to you


Throwing pennies at the fountain
But when you're standing on the mountain
It's kinda hard to aim
Like the tree we cut our names in,
There must be an explanation 
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

When I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Cause I swore when you said that you loved me,
Guess I heard you wrong

And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star


I don't think that passenger seat,
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night,
An' I count the colors in his eyes

He'll never fall in love,
He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind,
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But, I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you:
His favorite color's green,
He loves to argue,
Born on the seventeenth,
His sister's beautiful,
He has his father's eyes,
And if you ask me if I love him,
I'd lie

He looks around the room,
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had it memorized for so long
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
An' I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you:
His favorite color's green,
He loves to argue,
Born on the seventeenth,
His sister's beautiful,
He has his father's eyes,
And if you ask me if I love him,
I'd lie

He stands there, 
Then walks away
My God, if I could only say,
I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you, 
But he can play guitar
I think he can see through,
evrything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is:
My God, he's beautiful
So, I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you:
His favorite color's green,
He loves to argue,
Oh, and it kills me,
His sister's beautiful,
He has his father's eyes,
And if you ask me if I love him,
If you ask me if I love him,
I'd lie


The way you love is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me runnin
But I kind of know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you Smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something little hot
For when you'r not around
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you Smile

My mind forgets to advise me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and
It's really something
You find I'm even better
Than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard with the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I 
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk 
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly

Whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something little hot
For when you're not around
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you Smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase slowly
And whisper something slow
???????
Like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk 
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something little hot
For when you're not around
Cause I see sparks fly 
Whenever you
Smile

And the sparks fly
Yeah baby smile
And the sparks fly
Yeah


(Spoken):
We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along. To every song that I sing that you know please. As loud as you possibly can. I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.

To the left
To the left
Everything you own 
In the box to the left
In the closet

Please don't touch

Keep talking and yes thats fine
Could you walk and talk 
At the same time and

Come in with your bags

Standin in the front yard

How I'm never gonna find a man 
Like you

You're irreplaceable

So
Go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick
And see if she's home
Oops I bet you thought
That I didn't know
What'd ya think 
I was putting you out for
Cuz you were untrue
Haulin her around in the truck
That I bought you

Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin in the front yard
Tellin me

Talkin bout
How I'll never find a man like you
Got me twisted

So don't you ever for a second
Get to thinking
You're irreplacable
Yeah


She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun,
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by, 
Just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well, 
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind. 
She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
If you don't know what you want, nothings ever enough

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
Thats where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by, 
Just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when
And I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand it somehow

But If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by, 
Just south of knowing why

I just drive on by
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night

If I drive on
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night
Just south of knowing why


One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone, 
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things

Oil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
It means so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall

A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things, oho, yeah, 

No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
Strawberries and fairies with wings
They're for the little things, 
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah.


There's a little girl in this little town
with a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You can do better, that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances and smiles
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you
Do do do do do do do do

She sings her little songs
She walks a long a little
Halfway headed for the skies
Left to travel, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances and smiles
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

Maybe she'll sing you do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey, she'll love you
Funny how some view angels above you, ain't so far away.

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances and smiles
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do


Your feet under the table
 I love it when they’re touching mine
 Your hands make the ? cradle
 To tell me everything is fine
 All I see is you looking at me
 
Do you know when you go
 You make the sweetest sight at the window
 If you had never come out of the blue
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
 
You smile just like a picture
 It doesn’t even need a frame
 Sometimes I wait to answer
 Just to hear you say my name
 And all I want is just what i’ve got
 
Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
 If you had never come out of the blue
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
 
I’d never let you go
 Even If I could
 Cause I never could’ve dreamed you up this good
 
Oh oh
 
Do you know when you go
 You make the sweetest sight at the window
 If you had never come out of the blue
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You
 
Made Up You
 
Oh oh
 
Made Up You
 


I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your fake smile
Against your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long 
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me 
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now


Taylor (spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton
Um, I met him a couple months ago
Doing a show out in California
Um and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "Ya know I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music" and I read that and I'm like wow thats really cool so I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.And so, ya know, I asked him to come out and sing with me.And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? 

Crowd: 
Woo!!

Taylor (Spoken):
Thats what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up "Do you wanna be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks. And uh he goes "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video.Have yall seen that one? Would yall like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So uh, the song I asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. Ya see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley.So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So uh, Tyler ya gonna sing a song with me?

Tyler (spoken): 
Yeah
Lets do it!
If ya guys know, sing along too.

Taylor:
Everytime I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And your miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

Tyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinkin about you
And its almost driving me wild

But its my heart thats beggin down this long distance line tonight

Both:
And I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what I might say

Tyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight

You don't know how desperate I've become
And It looks like I'm loosein' this fight

But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine

Both:
But I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I aint missin' you at
No matter what my friends say

Taylor:
And there's a message that I'm sendin' out
Like a telograph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heart ache all alone

Both:
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missin' you
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say

Hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I ain't missin you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
Nooo 

Taylor (Spoken):
Good Night everybody!
Woo!
Woo
Ya like that girls?


Need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message I left on my car
Need you now
Word I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you
Now

Need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one way street
You need me now 
That's what you've been telling my friends
But I've come too far to go back there again
My heart and my number has changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

And i'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And i never heard you say
I need you, i need you
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you now


Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train

See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything


If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough

I'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
'Cos baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me

Sayin'

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old 
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget

It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet 

And if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one Summer you were mine

Sayin'

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe, this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old  
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved


I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
Cuz I ain't tryin to show maturity

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

I found those pictures
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
but he'll never find them all
Tried to tape them back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
X is the shape I drew

Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is your seeing is how much better off he is

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya

Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permenant marker
Oh ya

Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In Permanent marker

When they see old glory flyin
Theres a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night
When we lay down our head

Taylor:
My daddy served in the army
When he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard
Til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live free

Both:
Hey
Uncle Sam put your name
At the top of his list
And the statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly
And its gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom
Start ringing her bell

And it'll feel like 
The whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh brought to you courtesy
Of the red, white, and blue

Kellie:
Oh 
Justice will be served
And the battle will rage

Both:
This big dog

Kellie:
Will fight 
When you rattle his cage

Taylor:
You'll be sorry 
That you messed with
The U.S. of

Both:
A
We'll put a red high heel
In your ass
Its the American way

Now Uncle Sam
Put your name
At the top of his list
And the statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly
And its gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom
Start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like
The whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh ooh
Brought to you courtesy
Of the red, white, and blue


It's 10am, I catch the morning train,
And there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,
Saying "hey, I've been waiting for ya".
We'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,
We'd go so loud, but we don't care,
Cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.
You'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,
And just like that I swear it's like we've known each other our whole lives.
And this moment is perfect.
Train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.
Don't you dare be quiet.
This journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.
Lets take the ride of our lives.
This is the moment where the chemistry happens,
Yeah that special connection.
These are the days of our lives.
These are the times you'll never forget.
Never regret as long as we ride here side by side.
We can speak, we can dream,
This is our time, you and me,
Let's have the ride of our lives.
As we watch the world outside the window past,
I'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.
It's hard not to laugh out loud baby when you crack a joke.
You've got me smiling, got me thinking that I've got it all.
You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,
Cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.
I don't ever want this train ride to come to an end,
But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.
And the train's coming to a stop,
I'm still so lost in you I can't bare to get off.
You kiss me on the spot.

See you tomorrow, yeah tomorrow we can


There's a plane or a bus leaving from Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you aint got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy

Baby just come back
There's a short cut to the highway out of town
Why don't ya take it
Don't let that speed limit slow ya down
Go on and break it
Baby break it

And run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run


Let's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the


Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God’s graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing’s shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that’s what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I’m a little smarter, my heart’s a little harder
But it’s still soft enough to cry
‘Cause I remember those times

I remember………

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God’s graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing’s shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that’s what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
“Hey, how have you been?”
You caught me with that old smile
Said, “It’s really been a while,
Still think about back when…”

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing’s shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I’m someone new
And that’s what I learned from you

Oh, that’s what I learned from you
That’s what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That’s what I learned from you, oh yeah


Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along


It's this the way it's really going down?
 Is this how we say goodbye?
 Should've known better when you came around
 That you were gonna make me cry
 It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
 'Cause I know that you're living a lie
 That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...
 
What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 
What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 
You don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 Don't wanna hurt anymore
 And you tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, goes around
 Ohh no no no
 Ohh no no no
 Ohh no no no 

You're not sorry, ohh no no no
 
And every time you call him
 You spend your nights alone
 And he never comes home
 And every time you call him
 All you get's a busy tone
 I heard you found out
 That he's doing to you
 What you did to me
 Girl you got what you deserved
 



Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Makeup fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her,
She thinks about it

Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,
Shoes,purse, hair tied back and you should see her,
Shes got her magic, floating through the air,

Peace,Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big,Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pullin' up soon
She thinks about it as she sees headlights
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date,can't wait
Lookin' in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's lookin' right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
She's got her magic floating through the air

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by the small town lights
She got up again

Move out
Find out where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
Move to Paris livin' on a prayer

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear
Ooo Ooo


You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you gotta memorize
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

Don't worry yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be
And who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I'd tell them this is what I do
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

They say life on music row is rough conditions
Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be
And who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what've you got that I ain't?
And what do you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl
And who I've always been


Do you still have that dream,
That dream of you and me,
The dream that got us this far,
That got us to where we are.
Do you still want the same

Do you still want a me and you,

Time but I don't wanna let go,

Though I need you more than anything or anyone, I suppose I'll let it all go,but forever baby, my love for you will always grow, but one more time, so I know for sure,
Are you ready to walk away?
Leave me behind and forget
Our time everday? do you still want me, I know you will say no, but baby if you really don't love me, then just go,
But I still ...

Don't wanna leave you,

I betchya lie awake at night
Tryin to make up your sweet mind
Wonderin if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a california loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees 
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen 
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin next door
I'll be your angel givin up her wings
If that's whatchya need 
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees 
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen 
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin next door
I'll be your angel givin up her wings
If that's whatchya need
I'd give everything to be your anything

It's not like i'm givin up who i am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees 
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen 
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin next door
I'll be your angel givin up her wings
If that's whatchya need...

If that's whatchya need
I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees 
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen 
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin next door
I'll be your angel givin up her wings
If that's whatchya need


I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face in every space, every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes, will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day 
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face...

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feelin 
I used to get when you called
And then I wonder to myself
Who are you, where are you, where you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day 
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face...

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you....

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day 
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face 
Oh, no, no
I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna turn around


You said you were smarter 
I said just look at my report card 
You said you know more 
I said u know less then a door 
That's when I get to say 
I'm an 8th grade graduate 
Your a 6th grade idiot 
Don't you wish you were an 8th graduate!


One, two, three, four,
Before I know it, I'm out the door
Five, six, seven, eight,
Oh, why, didn't I, wait?
Nine and ten, 
I sure do regret, then

Oh wait! 
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait!  Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
So tell, me why,
It takes me time,
To wonder how,
How I got this far
But why, didn't I wait?
There was a chance, I needed to take!

Oh wait!
For another chance,
You need,
To take a little risk
So hey!
Just wait! 
Before it's too late
Just take, a chance
:
So imagine, what it would be like,
If we never took risks,
Or we never had a chance
To
Live
La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la ohh oh

Oh wait! 
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait! 
Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance 
Ohh oh


The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery why I surrender
Boy, you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, all your tattoos
Your every thought, your smile, your lips
And boy, the list goes on and on, and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive
You make me feel alive

Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me


I wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy, 
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter 
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter 
No one wrote

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter 
No one wrote


I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right now  



Taylor:
I know this isn't what I wanted,
Never thought it'd come this far,
Just thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are

Nick:
We were young and times were easy,
But I could see it's not the same.
I'm standing here but you don't see me,
I'd give it all for that to change.
And I dont want to lose her,
I dont want to let her go.

Taylor:
I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if its over,
Cause I will leave you alone.

Nick:
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

Nick:
And with every strike of lightning

Taylor:
Comes a memory that lasts

Nick Taylor:
Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash

Taylor:
Maybe I should give up

Taylor:
I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if its over,
Cause I will leave you alone.

Nick:
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

Taylor:
Trying to keep the light from going in

Nick and Taylor:
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
We always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm.

Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over- please don't leave me alone
Flooded with all this pain, knowing that I'll never hold you, like I did before the storm

Like I did before the storm


Well, I saw the things you were doing at the VMAs
And when I got that video award, you took the mic away
Now, I'll try to call security with every step I take
And nothing will even stop with all the music that I ever make

Don't think you're gonna win this time
'Cause you better believe that you're not what you do
I'll get ya! (yeah)
I'll get ya! (yeah)
And when I do, Kanye you'll be busted

I don't wanna be mean to you
But you better believe me when I tell you that
You are never what you do
You're busted. (Busted!)
Yeah, everybody makes mistakes
But, this is how it's gonna be until you apologize on the VMAs
You're busted!


Daddy,
I want you to know
How my heart aches with your loss
First your Father
Now your Mother
Life?s most precious treasure
?Parents?
Though they are no longer
With you on this earth
They will forever
Live in the hearts
Of all who loved them

I may not be right next to you
To tell you how much ?I love you?
I may not be right next to you
To give you a ?Hug? of comfort

Distance is a factor in our relationship
But you are in my thoughts
Everyday, from the moment I wake up
You are in my thoughts
You are in my heart
And you are in my prayers

I can never replace
The loss of my beloved grandparents
But as your Daughter
I will always be here for you
I am but a phone call away
And if you close your eyes and think of me
?Daddy I?m right beside you?


This melody is what your love means to me
I love you so much babe can't  you see
It is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm
Your love aways kept me safe and warm,

You had to walk through that open door
I suddenly fell down to the floor
It hurt so much to live without you
I tried not to think about you

You were more than I ever had
My love for you still makes me glad

So please come back we could start anew
No more sitting around feeling blue

So come on, it wil be just me and you
Don't hesitate
It would be great 
It's not too late
Lets celebrate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears the screaming
Then finally she sees them

It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason
Another way up?

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too?

He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep

Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
"We're here to die for our God"
He stood up and said, "That's funny
'Cause my God died for me"

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason
Another way up?

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis were full up
On the very day of
The rope 100 floors up
Just to come back down

They never thought they'd see the day
The, the tower'd be up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason
Another way up?

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
Where were you?
And didn't they pray, oh

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day


You say you want to wait to get married,
Why you in a pause,
You say it's not your time yet,
When is the perfect time for you

Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

What changed your mind in two days
Did I do something wrong to make you put a hold
On our future,
It was just a week ago when you asked me
What date I plan to ask you the big question,
Why did you do this to me

Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

It was perfectly set how it would go down
All our dream would have come real
Now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them
Should just add a stone to them and make it read
Here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,

Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you

Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

Why did yo do this 
Now I stand here with this ring, flowers, and dirt on my knees
Tears falling down my eyes with humiliation,
It might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me,
Tonight isnt a lucky night,

Now I can't look you in the eyes any more,
Just go ahead and walk away
Just leave me here in my misery of shame,

Just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
don't say you're sorry
And don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

You say you want to wait to get married
You say you're not ready yet
You say today isnt good enough for you
Do me a favor and do put me on hold,
Because I don't want to anymore


Someone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.
For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind
And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly


{Taylor}
I'm all alone and it's too dark
I need a man on my mark
In times like these I still need a guy
Nick you are so mine

Hey, Nick I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you

{Demi}
I'm still alone inside this cage
Still need a man but it's not the same
In times like these I still need a guy
Joe you are still mine

Hey, Joe I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you

{Taylor & Demi}
In times like these we still need some guys
Yeah, you are still mine

Hey, guys I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you

You see me giving people weird looks, I cant help it is ma face,
My kind is the odd and quiet type, but I can be loud when I want to,
Dont be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too,
You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but I'm not helping that task
You tell all your friends that I am real strange,
You cant talk cos your gay,
Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall,
You need give me space, ortherwise I will.... Nut you.

You call me a phyco, you dont know what your saying,
You call me every name under the starlit sky, 
Get a life, thats worth living, your making mine like hell.
Dont be gay, oops wait, your bi-sexual,
Dont be stupid and wreck your life,
Go away DJ, I aint that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge,
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone!


I am moving through the crowd
Trying to find myself
Feel like a guitar that's never played
Will someone strum away?

And I ask myself
Who do I wanna be?
Do I wanna throw away the key?
And invent a whole new me
And I tell myself
No One, No One
Don't wanna be
No One
But me..

You are moving through the crowd
Trying to find yourself
Feelin' like a doll left on a shelf
Will someone take you down?

And you ask yourself
Who do I wanna be?

Do I wanna throw away the key?
And invent a whole new me
Gotta tell yourself
No One, No One
Don't wanna be
No One
But me..

Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall
You turn the light on to erase it all
You wonder what it's like to not feel worthless
So open all the blinds and all the curtains

No One, No One
Don't wanna be
No One
But me..

We are moving through the crowd...


You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
I can see it
I can see it now



I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la,
La la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs
So that they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la,
La la la la la
This is my musical monologue!

You might think I'd bring up Joe
That guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not gonna mention him 
In my monologue

Hey Joe, I'm doing real well
Tonight I'm hosting SNL

But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, la la la

And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la,
La la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue

But there's nothing more to say
Cause every thing's okay
I've got security lining the stage

It's my SNL monologue
La la,
La la la la la
This is my SNL monologue

La la,
La la la la la
That was my SNL monologue



I don't want to break your heart
But you just keep on pushing me
I want to walk away
But you have ways of stopping me
I don't know what to say
Its just that I really want to leave
Cause your holding me back, holding me back from the life of luxury

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave

When ever we go out
I'm just a friend to you
But when we at home
You want to call me your boo
An I hate the fact
That when she comes around you make me go away
Its like you can't make up your mind
This is all I have to say

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave


You say I can count on you
But you just playing games
An I just let it slide
When call her name
You don't get it
I'm trying so hard not to walk away
But see now I'm tired of your two faces
So I'm just going to go my own way
Chorus:
So let me go my own way ( My own way)
Opposite from you ( From you, from you, from you)
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood ( Not in the mood)
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me ( You just keep hurting me)
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave ( Let me leave)

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way


(talking)
Wow it's been at least 5 years since I've seen her. Pfft it's hard to believe

(singing)
I can't believe it's been that long, why didn't your call, why didn't you write.
Was it cause of him or was it just cause you don't love me anymore. 
You could have found some way of contact me.

But I know it's not my fault 
Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around
I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner, I wouldn't have had to live my life this way
Now that he's gone will I get to see you again
At least hear your voice again

I think it's gonna workout this time around
We can be a family again not like before is gonna be different,
We're gonna do lot's of stuff together I think its gonna work out this time around not like before

But I know it's not my fault 
Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around
I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner 
I wouldn't have had to live my life this way cause I know it's not my fault now


(Spoken):
My name's Taylor Swift
This is a cover song I'm gonna sing for you
By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra
And its the song called Our Last Night

We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days were over
You were calling my name when your face faded from view

And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
And wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you

Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

And what ever happened to the things you loved
And the songs we played, and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and Maude and singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
And wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Oh oh yeah
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?
On our last night
Oh oh oh oh oh


[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me but

[Chorus]

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

[Chorus]


I don't know what I want
So don't ask me 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking, trying to see through the rain coming down

Even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Can you tell me what more do I need

And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah, but that's okay

I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission but I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl

You were the guy I always dreamed of. 
You were the guy that I loved. 
But then you had to leave me.
I asked when you would call me.
You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine.
I went there standin waitin to see your face.... 
You never showed up I was there for hours, I was waitin to see your face. 
I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light.
I'll wait all night till I see your face. 
Ohh waitin to see your face. 
I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you were there 
I saw you with another girl 
I didn't think to swear. 
I went home crying to see if you were there 
If a message was left I would cry my tears.
I was watin to see your face. 
I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light.
I'll wait all night till I see your face. 
Ohh waitin to see your face. 
Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin at me 
I was glad to see! 
We went we cried to the the wilderness---Im not alone.. 
Under the spot light any more.... 
Any more--- any more--- ANY MORE!


Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin
Wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me 
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
That's what you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been, looking in
Trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt
Every single time
But didn't you waltz right by
I'm screamin' out inside

Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me 
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?

Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do? 
But I was just a toy
That's what you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up
And see what you've lost
Take one look at me cause
That's what it  cost
I was gonna be everything you need
Cause you are everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me 
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
That's  what you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin


Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see


(Spoken:)
This one goes out to all my fans!

I'd just like to say

You guys make life rock
I depend on you
For your support

You were always there
When I needed you

Thank you
For everything
I wouldn't be here without you
Thank you
I love you all

Each one another

And I appreciate it

Thank you
For everything
I wouldn't be here without you
Thank you
I love you all

Oh yeah
Thank you all


Hey
Don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best
Try everything you can
Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything everything will be just fine
Everything everything will be all right, all right

Hey you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in
Live right now
Just be yourself
It doesn't matter if it's good enough, for someone else

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything everything will be just fine
Everything everything will be all right, all right (x2)

Hey - don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best
Do everything you can
Don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything everything will be just fine, everything everything will be all right.


She acts like shes 5 years old
Since it's cold she's got her big coat on
I hear people laugh at her
I look up bored
And she cries and runs
We start throwing stuff at her and she tries to hide
This starts to get old
She hugs her legs
And we put her to sleep
Im forced to take her home

And she's stupid to not know why the trees change in the fall.
And I know that she is scared
Of every little thing and all
She thinks snow whites house very near how dumb
But I know we had the worst day
Ever today.

She starts acting like shes 13 and thinks everyone is mean
She starts crying
And I push her away
And cut her with my keys
And she starts to drive and drive until she found a town far enough away
And she sulks and walks and  tries to forget all our names

And she know if shes ever going to finish school
And she knows shell never laugh
Cause we shrunk and she grew
She dont know how long it'll take to feel okay
But she knows she had the wors day ever today

She had a bullying father
She thought she was getting stronger
Her mom beats up her little brother
Inside and out hes more popular than she is
She grew up in an ugly house
And had no space to run
And she had the worst days with me

There was a video I found from back when we were three
She was trying to paint in the kitchen and she was talking to me
It was the age of teasing and bullying and throwing eggs at her window
And her dad was super dumb 
And I was the most handsome boy
In the whole wide world

And now she knows why
All the trees change in the fall
And she knows I was never on her side
And always said she was wrong
And she hates me
For giving her the evil eyes
And making her feel like 
She could shine
And I dont know if she knew
So I'm taking this chance to say 
That I always have the worst days
When I'm with you.


Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john, and so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing -- how

Deep you're sinking, round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble


You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray,
Protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, 
I didn't know you would be able to say all the things you did so I take them and put them up as a wall of gray, 
Protecting myself from the world I believe in

She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, 
While you ignored the world and listend to the fray,
And you said you wouldn't be imbarassed if you said that word again but we both go imbarassed when we said her name

The words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, 
We're not in a war so what are we fighting for, 
I don't know so just shut-up and say all the thing you've wanted to say, 
The page filled with words in gray and it's about you

I've never been anywhere cold as you,
You give rainy endings to perfect days, 
That's why I hate you for who you are

If you were the only thing I needed we wouldn't be this way, 
So she just said everything, everybody wanted her to say,
But I'm not gonna say it oh, no, no, no

She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, 
You promised me everything I wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead,
But you never gave us a damn thing so we cry,
Cry alone or is it together I don't know


The lies are always better left unsaid
So take the photos down of the wall
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a plane and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Now you know exactly how I feel
The truth is out and I can see what's real
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a scene and I want out
From all these stories that people tell

Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night alone dear
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night


I never saw it coming
The look in your eyes, showed me no surprise
You walked me to the front door and said
I love you and I'd never break your heart

You were so perfect 
You really lead me on
And gave me everything I ever wanted

Going out for dinner every night 
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
Going out to the football games
And then talking till sunrise
You gave me this and put me down 

I really thought we would improve

But you were the one, the one 
That I fell for

Going out for dinner every night 
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
Going out to the football games
And then talking till sunrise
You gave me this and put me down

You were the one 
That lead me on 
So here I go 
I hope shes worth it 

Going out for dinner every night 
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
Going out to the football games
And then talking till sunrise
You gave me this and put me down

Oh Oh Oh  
You were unperfect


We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up

No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We Were Happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happy


Turn WYCD on
You're on your Grunwald
Back from the Amazon
Ah huh huh

He's here with doctor Don
I heard they dropped him off
In the amazon
Ah huh huh

He caught an anaconda

Ate some piranhas
That's kinda disgusting
But whatever makes you happy
And I heard some naked boy
Showed him around
Yeah
Grunwald's back in town


Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said "Welcome to New York"
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
Beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped out bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want: boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
Beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York ''(New York)''
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love
It keeps you guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love
It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change
Anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me

''(Welcome to New York)''
New soundtrack, it's been waiting for you
''(Welcome to New York)''
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
''(Welcome to New York)''
So bright they never blind me

Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York


Jesus, Jesus, precious is your name
When you dwell in the fullness
Of your trinity the Lord

Crush me till the oil flows like rain
Healing my pain
Let the oil flow like rain
Crush me till the oil flows like rain
Healing my pain
Let the oil flow like rain

There's a healing in the house
Healing in the house
He has come to mend the broken-hearted
Healing in the house

There is joy in the house
Joy in the house
He has come to mend the broken-hearted
Joy in the house
There is joy in the house
Joy in the house
He has come to mend the broken-hearted
Joy in the house

Blessed be the father, the god of all creation
Blessed be the father, who reigns forevermore

Who reigns forevermore...


I can't believe you did it again, walk by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good, don't you know I'm trying to hate you
Tryin' to have a dream without you in it, but how can I put out this fire
When you're the one that lit it?
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
I keep writing songs about you

I got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
Something I can get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name, and I tear it all to shreds
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do

I keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind you want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay, cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
I'll just wait for the day, I'll stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
I keep writing songs about you.


You wanna dance you really wanna let it go
You want it bad but this time they told you to go
You want it

You try it fast when you really should do it slow
You got it bad and it's time I told you no
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!

You wanna laugh and you really wanna let them know
You're so relaxed and you really gonna let it show
You want it

Do you recall when we were two of a kind
But you chose your way, and I chose mine
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all
Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all and you got it all
But you got it all wrong!

We had a laugh, but it turned into a cough

We got along but now I wanna get off
You're on it

I was a kid when I did what you do
I put a lid on and thought that's it, I'm through
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all
Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all

Oh no!

And when I say you lose it, you don't believe it at all
Oh no!
It's such a long way to fall, the writings on the wall
Oh no!
But when I said you'd lose it, I can't even recall
Oh no!
If it was the best of all your brain a bit too small
Because you got it all, you got it all, you got it all
But you got it all wrong!


I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart
I look around, 
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, 
Listened to the radio,
Waited for something to come along,
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,
And I wrote down our song 


'''Liam:'''
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

'''Harry:'''
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

'''All:'''
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

'''Zayn:'''
So come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

'''Harry:'''
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

'''All:'''
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh 
That's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

'''Harry:'''
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful

'''All:'''
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
'''Harry:'''
That's what makes you beautiful


'''Liam:'''
Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed
'Cause I'm the foolish one that anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence 
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance

'''Harry:'''
Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you

'''Liam:'''
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
You've almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
But don't be scared, I ain't going no where

'''Zayn:'''
I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away 
I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

'''Harry:'''
It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you

'''Zayn:'''
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try
One more, one more time?
I'll make it better
One more, one more, can we try
One more, one more
Can we try one more time to make it all better?

'''Harry:'''
'Cause it's gotta be you
It's gotta be you 
Only you 
Only you

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you


'''Liam:'''
I've tried playin' it cool
But when I'm lookin' at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race

'''Harry:'''
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep makin' me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

'''Zayn:'''
Something’s gotta give now
'Cause I’m dyin' just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

'''All:'''
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

'''Niall:'''
Now I'm climbin' the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm goin' out of my mind
All day and all night

'''Louis:'''
Something’s gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to know your name
And I need you here with me now (Now)
'Cause you've got that one thing

'''All:'''
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
'''Harry:'''
You've got that one thing

'''Liam:'''
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

'''All:'''
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing 
And you've got that one thing


'''Liam:'''
I'm broken,
Do you hear me?
I'm blinded,
'Cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing, alone
I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around

And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

'''Harry:'''
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
I can love you more than this

'''Niall:'''
If I'm louder
Would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are, the same
You saved me, but when you leave it's gone again

'''Louis:'''
And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I'm on my knees
Praying

'''All:'''
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this

'''Zayn:'''
Yeah, I've never had the words to say
But now I'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms, yeah
And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That's shining from the stars above

'''Liam:'''
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
'''Zayn:'''
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

'''All:'''
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

'''Harry:'''
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this

When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this

'''Liam:''' 
I Can love you more than this


'''Liam:'''
It feels like we've been
Living in fast-forward
Another moment passing by
The party's ending, but
It's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight

'''Harry:'''
Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake
The floor to shake
People going all the way
Yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

'''All:'''
I wanna stay up all night and
Jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night and
Find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we got the floor now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and
Do it all with you

Up all night
Like this, all night
Up all night
Like this, all night
Up all night

'''Zayn:'''
Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back

'''Harry:'''
Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay

Up all night


'''Zayn:'''
He takes your hand
I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

'''Liam:'''
When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words gets trapped

'''Harry:'''
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you

'''All:'''
But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
'''Zayn:'''
Oh, how I wish, that was me

'''Harry:'''
He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things
I know that I could
If only time could just turn back

'''Zayn:'''
'Cause I got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you

'''All:'''
But, I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
'''Harry:'''
Oh, how I wish, that was me

'''Harry:'''
With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me
That you'll call later on
'Cause you wanna say good night

'''Niall and Liam:'''
'Cause, I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see

'''All:'''
But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
'''Harry:'''
Oh, how I wish
'''Zayn:'''
Oh, how I wish
'''Harry:'''
Oh, how I wish
That was me, me, me
'''Zayn:'''
Oh, how I wish, that was me


'''Liam:'''
Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried

'''Zayn:'''
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired

As you break my heart
Again this time

'''Zayn:'''
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
Than I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason
That you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you're thinking
'''Liam:'''
Tell me a lie

'''Liam:'''
Well, you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time

'''Harry:'''
And well, there must've been a time
I was a reason for that smile
So, keep in mind

'''Liam:'''
As you take what's left of 'You and I'

'''Zayn:'''
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
Than I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason
That you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you're thinking
'''Liam:'''
Tell me a lie

'''Zayn:'''
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
Than I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason
That you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you're thinking
'''Liam:'''
Tell me a lie

'''Zayn:'''
Tell me a lie
'''Liam:'''
Tell me a lie
'''Zayn:'''
Tell me a lie
'''Liam:'''
Tell me a lie


'''Liam:'''
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I'm with somebody else
You tell me you love me

I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along

'''Harry:'''
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken

You're messing with my head
Girl that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do 
To get me to say yes 
You're impossible to resist 
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it 
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake

Who do you think you are? 
Who do you think I am? 
You only love to see me breaking 
You only want me cause I'm taken 
You don't really want my heart 
No, you just like to know you can 
Still be the one who gets it breaking 
You only want me when I'm taken

'''Zayn:'''
Thank you for showing me 
Who you are underneath 
No, thank you, I don't need 
Another heartless misery 
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous 
And I know that you hate to hear this 
But this is not about you anymore

'''Harry:'''
Who do you think you are? 
Who do you think I am? 
You only love to see me breaking 
You only want me cause I'm taken 
You don't really want my heart 
No, you just like to know you can ('''Zayn:''' no you don't, no you don't)
Still be the one who gets it breaking ('''Zayn:''' breaking!
You only want me when I'm taken

'''Liam:'''
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me 


'''Harry:'''
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

You could be preoccupied
Different date, every night
You've just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
The girls say...

'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Louis:'''
But that's crazy
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Louis:'''
And that's not me
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

'''Liam:'''
You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say...

'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Harry:'''
But that's crazy
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Niall:'''
And that's not me
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

'''Louis:'''
Oh, and all the girls say

'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Zayn:'''
But that's crazy
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Niall:'''
And that's not me
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

'''Zayn:'''
Be loved by you
I wanna, I'll stay true
I wonder, if you knew
What you put me through
Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too?

'''Liam:'''
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

'''Zayn:'''
Oh, and all the girls say

'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Louis:'''
But that's crazy
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Niall:'''
And that's not me
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Harry:'''
And all the girls say
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, 
'''Zayn:'''
And that's crazy
'''All:'''
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you


'''Liam:'''
You know I've always
Got your back, girl
So, let me be the one
You come running to
Running to, r-r-running

I say this is just a matter of fact, girl
You just call my name
I'll be coming through
Coming through, I'll keep coming

'''Harry:'''
On the other side of the world
It don't matter, I'll be there in two
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feel it everytime
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

'''All:'''
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do, do
It's everything about you

'''Niall:''''
Guess I like the way you smile
With your eyes
Other guys see it, but don't realize
That it's m-my loving

There's something about your laugh
That makes me wanna have to
There's nothing funny, so
We laugh at n-n-nothing

'''Louis:'''
Every minute's like the last, so
Let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock
That's tic-tic-ticking

'''Harry:'''
I still feel it everytime
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

'''All:'''
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do, do
It's everything about you

'''Zayn:'''
And you have always been
The only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know
Without you, I can't face it

'''Zayn and Harry:'''
All we wanna have is fun
But they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

'''All:'''
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do, do
It's everything about you


'''Harry:''' 
Circles, we're going in circles
Dizzy's all it makes us 
We know where it takes us
We've been before 
Closer, maybe looking closer 
There's more to discover 
Find out what went wrong
Without blaming each other

'''Zayn:''' 
Think that we got more time 
When we're falling behind 
Gotta make up our minds

'''All:''' 
Or else we'll play, play, play
All the same old games 
And we wait, wait, wait
For the end to change 
And we take, take, take
It for granted 
That we'll be the same 
But we're making all the
Same mistakes

'''Liam:'''
Wake up, we both need to wake up 
Maybe if we face up, to this 
We can make it through this 
Closer, maybe we'll be closer 
Stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah 

'''Zayn:'''
Think that we got more time 
When we're falling behind 
Gotta make up our minds

'''All:'''
Or else we'll play, play, play
All the same old games 
And we wait, wait, wait
For the end to change 
And we take, take, take
It for granted 
That we'll be the same 
But we're making all the
Same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is 
When it's broke, and you say
"There's nothing to fix."
And you pray, pray, pray
That everything will be okay 
While you're making all the
Same mistakes 

'''Liam:''' 
Don't look back
But, if we don't look back
We're only learning then
How to make all the same mis-
Same mistakes, again

'''All:'''
So, we play, play, play
All the same old games ('''Zayn:''' The same mistakes)
And we wait, wait, wait
For the end to change ('''Zayn:''' But, nothing's gonna change)
And we take, take, take
It for granted
That we'll be the same  ('''Zayn:''' But, nothing's gonna be the same)
But we're making all the
Same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is ('''Zayn:''' Crazy is)
When it's broke, and you say
"There's nothing to fix." ('''Zayn:''' There's nothing to fix)
And you pray, pray, pray ('''Zayn:''' Oh)
That everything will be okay ('''Liam:''' Everything will be okay)
While you're making all the
Same mistakes

Waiting for a girl like you

The light shines
It's getting hot on my shoulders.
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter.
'Cause your friends,
They look good and you look better.
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, round, round

With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love

To steal my heart tonight

And we can stay here tonight
'Cause there's so much that I wanna say

From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain 
'''Harry:'''
I had to take you and make you mine
'''Niall:'''
Take you and make you mine

'''Liam:'''
I would walk through the desert 
I would walk down the aisle 
I would swim all the oceans 
Just to see you smile
'''Harry:'''
Whatever it takes is fine
'''Niall:'''
Whatever it takes is fine

'''All:'''
So put your hands up
Cause it’s a stand up
And I won’t be leaving 
‘til I finish stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

'''Louis:'''
I know your hearts been broken
But don’t you give up

To fix you with love

'''Liam:'''
Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this even though I try

Heart beats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

'''Harry:'''
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

'''All:'''
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

'''Niall:'''
Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded
Like tonight's sky

'''Louis:'''
Hands are silent
Voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

'''Harry:'''
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

'''All:'''
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

'''Zayn:'''
Flashing lights in my mind
Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all

'''All:'''
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

You know I'll be
Your life, your voice your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today


'''Liam:'''

I'm just tryna' read the signals I'm receiving
Just like a stone on fire can you feel it?

'''Niall:'''
Words will be just words
'Til you bring them, to life

'''Liam:'''
We've got a bit of love/hate
You take me to the edge
Then you hit the breaks
I say it's over one day
But then I'm crawling back
Begging you to stay
We make up and
We break up all the time

I'll say that I hate a song
Then you'll go request it
The whole night long
Some people say it's so wrong
But, even when we fight
Girl, you turn me on
'''Liam and Harry:'''
We make up and
We break up all the time

'''All:'''

All you do is complain
You know that
It drives me insane

'''Liam:''' 
I keep playing it inside my head, all that you said to me
I lie awake just to convince myself this wasn't just a dream

"Cause you were right here" 
'''Harry:'''
And I should have taken the chance
'''Liam:'''
But I got so scared 
'''Harry:'''
And I lost the moment again
It's all that I can think about, 
Oh, you're all that I can think about

'''All:'''
Is your heart taken? 
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? 
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when,
When I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you (x4)

'''Liam:'''
Every morning when I leave my house, I always look for you
I see you every time I close my eyes what am I gonna do?

And all my friends say 
'''Zayn:'''
That I'm punching over my weight
'''Liam:'''
But in your eyes, I 
'''Zayn:'''
Saw how you were looking at me.

'''Louis and Harry:'''
It's all that I can think about, 
Oh, you're all that I can think about

'''All:'''
Is your heart taken? 
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? 
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you (x4)

'''Zayn:'''
When you stood there, just a heartbeat away,
When we were dancing and you looked up at me,
If I had known then, that I'd been feeling this way,
If I could replay I would never have let you go.

'''Liam:'''
No oh, Never have let you go.
Am I out of time?

'''All:'''
Is your heart taken? 
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused

Your hand fits in mine
Like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me

'''Liam'''
I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile
You've never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

'''Zayn and Liam'''
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

'''Louis'''
You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

'''Harry'''
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

'''Harry and Niall'''
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
but if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

'''Niall'''
You'll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know
I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you
Oh..

'''Harry'''
I've just let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you
Oh it's you
It's you
They add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things

'''All'''
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all your little things

I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah.

'''Niall:'''
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now

'''Zayn:'''
I'm trying to be okay
I'm trying to be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right

'''All:'''
And I'm like OW!
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and OW!
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one it's ...
OW!
Giving me a heart attack 
Getting over you

'''Louis:'''
Oh, oh
Yeah every time you look like that, oh oh
You're givin' me a heart attack.
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right

'''All:'''
And I'm like
Ow!
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and ow!
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do 
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one it's...
Ow!
Giving me a heart attack 
Getting over you

'''Zayn:'''
You're all I ever wanted.
Ow!

'''Harry:'''
Yeeeeah
Everytime you look like that

'''Zayn:'''
You're all I ever wanted
You're giving me a heart attack
OooW!


'''Harry:'''
Do you remember summer '09?
Want to go back there every night
Just can't lie, it was the best time of my life

Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh my my, they can never shut us down

'''Louis:'''
I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever want to let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered I will always believe

'''All:'''
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal
Show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah

'''Liam:'''
Yeah we were together summer '09
Want to roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye

'''Louis:'''
I used to think that I was better alone ('''Harry:''' better alone)
Why did I ever want to let you go? ('''Harry:''' let you go)
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea ('''Harry:''' stared at the sea)
The words you whispered I will always believe

'''All:'''
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal
Show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah

R-O-C-K me again
R-O-C-K me again
R-O-C-K me again, yeah
I want you to
R-O-C-K me again
R-O-C-K me again
R-O-C-K me again, yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal
Show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal
Show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah


'''Louis:'''
The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone's gone

'''Zayn:'''
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

'''Liam:'''
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh
We take photographs
There's no music on
But we dance alone

'''Harry:'''
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

'''All:'''
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
'''Zayn:'''
I'll change my mind
I'll change my mind

'''Niall:'''
Baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind

'''All:'''
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So baby if you say you want me to stay
'''Zayn:'''
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind


'''Liam:'''
Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got

'''Harry:'''
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

'''Zayn:'''
Would he say he's in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would
'''All:'''
Would he say he's in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

'''Niall:'''
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going all right
With a sign on my back saying 'kick me'
Reality ruined my life

'''Louis:'''
It feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos

'''Zayn:'''
Would he say he's in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would
'''All:'''
Would he say he's in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would

'''Louis:'''
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

'''Harry:'''
Would he say he's in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

'''Louis:'''
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

'''All:'''
Would he say he's in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would


'''Liam:'''
Said I'd never leave her
'Cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue-tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips

'''Niall:'''
Now she's feeling so low
Since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again

'''All:'''
If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

'''Harry:'''
Can we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say
If I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell your heart isn't in it or with it

'''Louis:'''
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down
Like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

'''All:'''
If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

'''Zayn:'''
You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?

'''Liam:'''
If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
'''All:'''
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
'''Harry:'''
So we can start it all over again


'''Liam:'''
Whenever I close my eyes I picture you there
I'm looking out at the crowd
You're everywhere
I'm watching you from the stage, yeah
Your smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up
You're hearing me say
'''Harry:'''
Goodbye

'''All:'''
Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you

'''Louis:'''
I've never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch
I only want more
So tell me nothing's gonna change, yeah
And you won't ever walk away, yeah
'Cause even though every night
You'll know what I'll say
'''Harry:'''
Goodbye

'''All:'''
Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you

'''Louis:'''
Right back for you
Right back for you
Right back for you

'''Liam:'''
Lately I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back
Yeah I am coming back
'''Zayn:'''
For you!

'''All:'''
Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, for you
Lately I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you
Right back for you
Right back for you
Right back for you

Lately I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you


'''Liam:'''
People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say they don't know
What they're talk talk talking about

'''Harry:'''
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't want to wait any longer
I just want to tell the world
That you're mine, girl, oh

'''Zayn:'''
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love you"s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
'''All:'''
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don't know about
They don't know about us

'''Niall:'''
One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter

'''Harry:'''
It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl

'''Zayn:'''
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love you"s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
'''All:'''
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don't know about
They don't know about us

'''Louis:'''
They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don't know us

'''Niall:'''
They don't know what we do best
It's between me and you, our little secret
'''Zayn:'''
But I want to tell 'em
I want to tell the world that you're mine, girl

'''All:'''
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love you"s ('''Zayn:''' I love you!)
But I bet you if they only knew ('''Zayn:''' If they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us ('''Zayn:''' they would just be jealous of us)
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right ('''Zayn:''' feels so right)
Baby they don't know about
They don't know about us

They don't know about the things we do ('''Zayn:''' they don't know about us!)
They don't know about the "I love you"s ('''Zayn:''' they don't know about us!)
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don't know about
They don't know about us

'''Zayn:'''
They don't know about us


'''Zayn:'''
Yeah
Oooh, oooh

Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye

'''Harry:'''
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

'''Zayn:'''
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

'''Louis:'''
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

'''Liam:'''
Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you will remember when the sky is gray

'''Zayn and Harry:'''
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

'''Zayn and Niall:'''
So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
'''Zayn and Harry:'''
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

'''Zayn:'''
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
'''Harry:'''
Feels like snow in September
'''Harry and Zayn:'''
But I always will remember
'''All:'''
You were my summer love ('''Louis:''' Summer love!)
You always will be my summer love ('''Niall:''' Summer love)
You always will be my summer love 
You always will be my summer love


'''Louis:'''
Yeah!
1 2 3 4!

'''Harry:'''
She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go
Oh woah, let it go

'''Louis:'''
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home
Oh, take her home

'''Liam:'''
But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

'''Zayn:'''
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

'''Niall:'''
Maybe she's just trying to test me
Want to see how hard I'm gonna work
Want to see if I can really tell 
How much she's worth (What'cha worth)

'''Louis:'''
Or maybe all of her friends have told her 
Don't get closer, he'll just break your heart
'''Niall:'''
But either way she's teasing me
And it's just so hard (So hard)

'''Liam:'''
'Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real

'''Zayn:'''
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

'''Harry:'''
What about all the the things we say
Talking on the phone so late
I can't let her get away from me, oh

'''Zayn:''''
When I say that I can't do it no more
She's back at my door, she's not afraid!

'''All:'''
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild ('''Zayn:''' running wild)
How come she's so afraid of falling in love? ('''Zayn:''' falling in love)
She's not afraid of scary movies ('''Zayn:''' she's not afraid)
She likes the way we kiss in the dark ('''Zayn:''' kiss in the dark)
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love

'''Zayn:'''
She's not afraid
She's not afraid


'''Zayn:'''
Girl, that should be me
Driving to your house
Knocking on your door
Kissing you on the mouth

'''Liam:'''
Holding on your hand
Dancing in the dark
'Cause I was the only one
Who loved you from the start

'''Harry:'''
But now when I see you with him
It tears my world apart

'''All:'''
Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
'''Harry:'''
Baby, I loved you first

'''Louis:'''
Girl, it should be me
Calling on your phone
Saying you're the one
And that I'll never let you go

'''Harry:'''
I never understood
What love was really like
But I felt it for the first time
Looking in your eyes

'''Liam:'''
But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart

'''All:'''
Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first

'''Zayn:'''
The first touch, the first kiss
The first girl who made me feel like this
Heartbreak, it's killing me
I loved you first, why can't you see?

'''Niall:'''
I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse

'''Zayn:'''
Baby, I loved you first!
'''All:'''
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know

'''Zayn:'''
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first, oh yeah
'''Harry:'''
Baby, I loved you first


'''Niall:'''
You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart

'''Zayn:'''
You're so London, your own style, your own style
And together we're so good, so girl why
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
You're tearing me apart

'''Harry:'''
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did
Let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

'''All:'''
'Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
'''Harry:'''
Nobody compares to you

'''Louis:'''
We're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You're tearing up my heart

'''Harry:'''
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did
Let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

'''All:'''
'Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
'''Harry:'''
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

'''Niall:'''
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

'''All:'''
'Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
'''Harry:'''
Nobody compares to you


'''Liam:'''
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while but baby
I got something that I really want to let you know
Yeah, something that I want to let you know

'''Louis:'''
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone
Yeah, I know that I left you all alone

'''Harry:'''
Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should have seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

'''All:'''
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
You might have moved on but girl you should know
But I know you're still the one
I know I say it too much
But I won't ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
I know you're still the one

'''Niall:'''
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I want to hear
Yeah, girl just tell me what I want to hear

'''Harry:'''
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said
Yeah, I can't get it out of my head

'''Zayn:'''
Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should have seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

'''All:'''
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
You might have moved on but girl you should know
But I know you're still the one
I know I say it too much
But I won't ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one

Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, 
'''Harry:'''
You're still the one!

'''All:'''
I know I say it too much
But I won't ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
I know you're still the one


'''Liam:'''
Am I asleep, am I awake, or somewhere in between?
I can't believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined
Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine?

'''Niall:'''
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

'''Harry and Louis:'''
Truly madly deeply, I am
Foolishly completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you'll always keep me
Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you
In love with you

'''Liam:'''
Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said?
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act all cool like it was no big deal?

'''Zayn:'''
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
Or put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here's the tragic truth, if you don't feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

'''Harry and Louis:'''
Truly madly deeply, I am
Foolishly completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you'll always keep me
Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you

'''Louis:'''
I hope I'm not a casualty
Hope you won't get up and leave
'''Louis and Niall:'''
Might not mean that much to you
But to me it's everything
Everything

'''All:'''
Truly madly deeply, I am
Foolishly completely fallen
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you'll always keep me
Truly madly crazy deeply in love with you
'''Zayn:'''
In love with you
In love with you
With you


'''Harry:'''
B-b-b-baby come on over
I don't care if people find out
They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out

'''Liam:''' 
But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you want to be bad
And girl when you're looking like that
I can't hold back

'''All:''' 
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kissed you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

'''Zayn:''' 
So l-l-let them take our picture
Spread it all around the world now
I want to put it on my record
I want everyone to know now

'''Liam:''' 
But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you want to be bad
Girl when you're looking like that
'''Harry:''' 
I can't hold back

'''All:'''
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kissed you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic

'''Niall:''' 
They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
I want to put it on my record
I want everyone to know now

'''Louis:'''
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic

'''All:''' 
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kissed you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

Come on!
Kissed you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic


'''Harry:'''
Don't try to make me stay
Or ask if I'm okay
I don't have the answer
Don't make me stay the night
Or ask if I'm alright
I don't have the answer

'''Liam:'''
Heartache doesn't last forever
I'll say I'm fine
Midnight ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye

'''Zayn:'''
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes irresistible

'''Niall:'''
I've tried to ask myself
Should I see someone else?
I wish I knew the answer

'''Harry:'''
But I know if I go now, if I leave
Then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer

'''Liam:'''
Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I'm falling down down down
That's why

'''Zayn:'''
I find your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes irresistible

'''All:'''
Irresistible ('''Zayn:''' irresistible)
Irresistible ('''Zayn:''' irresistible)
Irresistible ('''Zayn:''' irresistible)
Irresistible

'''Harry:'''
It's in your lips and in your kiss
It's in your touch and your fingertips
And it's in all the things and other things
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible

'''Louis:'''
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
'''Zayn:'''
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes 
Irresistible


'''Harry'''
Maybe it’s the way she walked (ow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (ow)
Just like she already owned it

'''Zayn'''
I said, "Can you give it back to me"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

'''All'''
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "oh oh oh"
I think it went, "yeah yeah yeah"
I think it goes... (woooo)

'''Liam'''
Said her name was Georgia Rose (ow)
And her daddy was a dentist
'''Harry'''
Said I had a dirty mouth (I had a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

'''Niall'''
I said, "Can I take you home with me"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

'''All'''
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "oh oh oh"
I think it went, "yeah yeah yeah"
I think its goes... (woooo)

'''Louis'''
You know, I know, you know I’ll remember you
I know, you know, I know you’ll remember me
'''Zayn'''
You know, I know, you know I’ll remember you
I know, you know, I hope you remember how we danced

(Oh oh oh)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(How we danced)

'''Harry:'''
One, two, one two three
Ow!

'''All'''
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
('''Harry:''' We danced, we danced)
('''Harry:''' And it goes something like this)
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
('''Zayn:''' How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her)
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
('''Zayn:''' Best song ever)
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "oh oh oh"
I think it went, "yeah yeah yeah"
I think its goes... (woooo)

'''Zayn'''
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever


'''Harry'''
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

'''Liam'''
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

'''Zayn'''
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

'''Harry'''
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
'''All:'''
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

'''Niall'''
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage

'''Liam'''
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light upon the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

'''Louis'''
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

'''Harry'''
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
'''All:'''
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

'''Zayn'''
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

'''Niall'''
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen

'''All'''
The story of my life I give her hope ('''Zayn:''' give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside ('''Zayn:''' until she's broke inside)
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
'''Harry'''
The story of my life


'''Zayn:'''
Diana

'''Liam:'''
The front page is all your pictures,
They make you look so small,
How could someone not miss you at all?

(Oh-ah-oh)

'''Harry:'''
I never would mistreat ya,
No, I’m not a criminal,
I speak a different language but I still hear your call.

'''All:'''
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely, you don’t even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don’t think you even realize, baby you’d be saving mine.

'''Zayn:'''
Diana

'''Niall:'''
It’s only been four months but,
You’ve fallen down so far,
How could someone mislead you at all?

(Oh-ah-oh)

'''Louis:'''
I wanna reach out for ya,
I wanna break these walls,
I speak a different language but I still hear you call.

'''All:'''
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely, you don’t even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don’t think you even realize baby you’d be saving mine.

'''Harry:'''
We all need something,
This can’t be over now,
If I could hold ya,
Swear I’d never put you down.

'''All:'''
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely, you don’t even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don’t think you even realize baby you’d be saving mine.

'''Zayn:'''
Diana,
Diana,
'''Harry:'''
Baby you’d be saving mine,
'''Zayn:'''
Diana,
Diana,
'''Harry:'''
Baby you’d be saving mine


'''Harry:'''
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh but we don't listen

'''Louis:'''
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh woah

'''All:'''
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

'''Liam:'''
5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby follow me

'''Niall:'''
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh but a different day

'''Louis:'''
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh woah

'''All:'''
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it

'''Niall:'''
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby this is what the night is for

'''Harry:'''
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more!
Ohhh woahhhh!!

'''All:'''
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it


'''Niall:'''
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

'''Liam:'''
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

'''Harry:'''
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
No nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

'''Zayn, Liam & Niall:'''
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

'''Louis, Liam & Niall:'''
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us

'''Harry:'''
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us

'''Zayn:'''
'Cause You and I

'''All:'''
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
No nothing can come between you and I

'''Harry:'''
Oh, you and I
You and I
'''Zayn:'''
We can make it if we try
You and I, 
'''Harry:'''
Oh You and I


'''Liam:'''
Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Well I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home

'''Niall:'''
Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Well I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home

'''All:'''
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
'''Harry:'''
And the proof is in this song

'''Harry:'''
I've been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go

'''All:'''
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

'''Louis:'''
Lights off
When they should be on
Even stars in the skies they're wrong

'''Zayn:'''
Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done

'''Louis and Zayn:'''
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always feeling at home

'''All:'''
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong ('''Zayn:''' don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
'''Zayn:'''
Never, never, never!

'''All:'''
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home ('''Niall:''' Don't forget it)
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

Home, don't forget it
Home, If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own ('''Zayn:''' You were never!)
'''Liam:'''
And the proof is in this song

'''Niall:'''
Never forget it
This song
'''Zayn:'''
Don't forget it
'''Liam:'''
No I'll never forget it this song
'''Zayn:'''
You were never...


'''Zayn:'''
My hands, your hands
Tied up like two ships drifting
Weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?

'''Liam:'''
My heart, your heart
Sit tight like bookends
Pages between us
Written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

'''All:'''
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
'''Harry:'''
That you make me strong

'''Louis:'''
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always try to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

'''All:'''
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

'''Zayn:'''
So baby hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong

'''Niall:'''
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

'''All:'''
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
'''Harry:'''
That you make me strong

'''All:'''
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
'''Harry:'''
That you make me strong


'''Harry:'''
You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so you had to walk away

'''Niall:'''
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
'''Zayn:'''
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

'''Harry:'''
(1, 2, 3)

'''All:'''
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
'''Harry:'''
Baby be with me so happily

'''Liam:'''
It's 4am, and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin

'''Louis:'''
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry love but I don't really care

'''Niall:'''
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
'''Zayn:'''
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

'''Harry:'''
(1, 2, 3)

'''All:'''
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
'''Harry:'''
Baby be with me so happily
'''Liam:'''
So happily

'''Harry:'''
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now

'''All:'''
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now ('''Zayn:''' we're on fire)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now

'''All:'''
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
'''Harry:'''
Baby be with me so happily


'''Louis:'''
Lights go down
And the night is calling to me, yeah
I hear voices singing songs in the street
And I know

'''Niall:'''
That we won't be going home
For so long, for so long
But I know that I won't be on my own, yeah
I love this feeling and

'''Zayn:'''
Right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me

'''Liam:'''
Late night, spaces
With all our friends, you and me, yeah
Love these faces
Just like how it used to be

'''Harry:'''
And we won't be going home
For so long, for so long
But I know I won't be on my own, on my own
I'm feeling like

'''Zayn:'''
Right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me

And I could do this forever
And let's go crazy together

'''Harry:'''
Lights go down
And I hear you calling to me, yeah

'''Zayn:'''
Right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me


'''Harry and Louis:'''
Little black dress just walked into the room
Making heads turn can't stop looking at you
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right you know
Little black dress, did you come here alone?
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright you know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright you know

'''All:'''
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

'''Zayn, Niall and Liam:'''
Little black dress who you doing it for?
Little black dress I can't take any more
It's not right, it's not right, it's not right you know

'''All:'''
Little black dress, what's your favorite song?
Little black dress I won't do you no harm
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright you know
It's alright, it's alright, 'cause I'll take you home

I wanna see the way you move for me baby

I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me


'''Liam:'''
You tell me that you sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hiding
And I just wanna see you

You tell me that you're hurt, and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again

'''Niall:'''
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It will come back to you
And I'll be here for you

'''Harry:'''
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

'''Zayn:'''
I wish that I could take you to the start
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold you

'''Louis:'''
You tell me that you heard it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you laughing
So let's just laugh again

'''Niall:'''
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It will come back to you
Back to you

'''All:'''
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way 
'''Zayn:'''
Through the dark

'''Zayn:'''
And you don't need
You don't need to worry
And you will see it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved

'''Liam:'''
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love

'''All:'''
Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer

'''Harry:'''
Through the dark

Oh I will carry you over fire and water for your love ('''Zayn:''' Oh I would, Oh I would)
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down
We will find a way 
'''Zayn:'''
Through the dark


'''Liam:'''
One day you'll come into my world and say it all
You say we'll be together even when you're lost

'''Zayn:'''
One day you'll say these words I've thought but never said
You say we're better off together in our bed

'''Harry:'''
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

'''Niall:'''
The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again

'''Harry:'''
One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight

'''Harry:'''
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining, oh
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

'''Zayn:'''
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

'''Harry and Zayn:'''
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
Is it too much to ask for something great?

'''Louis:'''
You're all I want
So much it's hurting
You're all I want
So much it's hurting


'''Harry:'''
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'''Zayn:'''
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies

'''Liam:'''
You say it's getting late, it's getting late
And you don't know if you could stay, if you could stay
But you, you don't tell the truth
No, you, you like playing games

'''Louis and Liam:'''
Your hands touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They're saying what we'd do
When it's only me and you
I can't concentrate

'''Niall:'''
That's all I'm thinking about
All I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away

'''All:'''
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies

'''Zayn and Liam:'''
Backseat of the cab, we're in the cab now
Or lips getting so attached, they're so attached now
You wanna make some rules now
Cool, then we'll watch them break tonight

'''Niall:'''
I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long

'''All:'''
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies

'''Zayn:'''
I know you want it
I know you feel it too
Let's stop pretending'
That you don't know and I don't know
Just what we came to do

'''All:'''
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your, little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies


'''Harry:'''
Better than words
But more than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling

'''Liam:'''
Everytime we touch
I'm all shook up
You make me wanna
How deep is your love?
God only knows
Baby

'''All:'''
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, oh
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, oh
I can't explain your love, no
'''Zayn:'''
It's better than words
'''Harry:'''
Better than words

'''Louis:'''
Better than words
You drive me crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby

'''Niall:'''
Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna
One more night
Irreplaceable ('''Harry:''' Yeah)
Crazy, we're crazy

'''All:'''
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, oh
There's no way I can explain your love, no ('''Harry:''' There's no way I can explain your love)
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, no
I can't explain your love, no

'''Louis:'''
Everyone tries ('''Harry:''' they try)
To see what it feels like ('''Harry:''' feels like)
But they'll never be right
'''Louis and Harry:'''
'Cause it's better, it's better, it's better

[Liam]
Ooooh oooh oooh oh
One more time...
Oooh oooh oooh oh
Better than words...Yeah

'''All:'''
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up ('''Zayn:''' I don't know!)
'Cause words ain't good enough, oh
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up ('''Harry:''' to sum it up)
'Cause words ain't good enough ('''Harry:''' words ain't good enough)
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
'''Zayn:''' 
It's better than words
It's better than words


'''Harry:'''
I know you want, know you want to take it slow
But think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight
Just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side
Just give me the key

'''Zayn:'''
'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?

'''Liam:'''
Say the word, say the word
But don't say "no"
Sky dive, you and I with just these clothes
Your secret's safe with me
There's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see
We'd do it anyway

'''Harry:''' 
'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?

'''Niall:'''
Hey, I don't want you be the one that got away
I wanna get addicted to you yeah
You're rushing through my mind
I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted
Don't say, no-o-o-o

'''Louis:'''
'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?

'''All:'''

Why don't you go there with me?
'''Louis:'''
With me, with me
'''Zayn:'''
Why don't you go there with me?


'''Liam:'''
He knows about you in every way
He's memorized every part of your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know

'''Harry:'''
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
Your favorite band, the way that you dance
Baby, baby

'''All:'''
Does he know you can move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know your out and I want you so bad?
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
Does he know?

'''Liam:'''
I catch your eye then you turn away
But there's no hiding the smile on your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
He's not around, girl, you let me know

'''Niall:'''
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
He knows how you dance in front of your friends
But baby, baby

'''All:'''
Does he know you can move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know your out and I want you so bad?
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh

'''Louis:'''

The way you lie when you look at me
So keep trying but you know I see
All the little things that who make you who you are
So tell me girl

'''Liam:'''
Does he know you could move it like that?
Does he know that you'll never go back? Woah

[All]
Does he know you can move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know your out and I want you so bad?
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Does he know?


'''Liam:'''
My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor, can you find out what is wrong with me?
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet
I can't control it
Yeah, I know it's taking over me

I'm going crazy
Can't contain it
'''Zayn:'''
So tell me just what I should do, oh

'''All:'''
She said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
She said, hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive

'''Niall:'''
Went to a party, just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her, end up to the balcony
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said okay, but she was worried what her friends will think

'''Liam:'''
She's going crazy
Can't contain it
'''Zayn:'''
She asked me what should I do?

'''All:'''
I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive

'''Louis:'''
We got to live before we get older
Do what we like
We got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
We got nothing to prove

'''Liam:'''
I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight

'''All:'''
I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive


'''Liam:'''
So your friends been telling me
You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
Because I'm missing half of me

'''Zayn:'''
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm a half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

'''Louis:'''
Forget all we said that night
No it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two

'''Zayn:'''
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for the lunch down by the river
We could really talk it through

'''Harry and Louis:'''
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

'''Harry and Niall:'''
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

'''Harry:'''
Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you

'''Niall:'''
Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been waking up to

'''All:'''
Only half a blue sky ('''Niall:''' only half a blue sky)
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
Without you, without you

'''Harry:'''
There's a lightning in your eyes I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat running out of time
Without you I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright

'''Liam:'''
There's a devil in your smile that's chasing me
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine

'''All:'''
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
I'll never look back now I'm ready to run
'''Harry:'''
I'm ready to run

'''Niall:'''
There's a future in my life I can't foresee 
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me
'''Louis:'''
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright

'''All:'''
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
I'll never look back now I'm ready to run

'''Zayn:'''

I'll never look back now I'm ready to run


'''Niall:'''
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go

So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

'''Zayn:'''
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
'''All:'''
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

'''Liam:'''
Yeah, a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
It's at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy

'''Harry:'''
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you've never heard enough
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

'''Zayn:'''
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

'''Harry:'''
Are you sleeping baby by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Trying to find you but I just don't know
'''All:'''
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

'''Harry:'''
Tell me now tell me now
Tell me where you're going
You've been afraid
Tell me now tell me now
Tell me will you ever love me again?
Love me again?

'''Zayn:'''
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

'''Harry:'''
Are you sleeping baby by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know

'''Louis:'''
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
'''Harry:'''
Come on baby, cause I need you now

'''Louis:'''
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, cause I’m ten feet down
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on baby, come and get me out
'''Zayn:'''
Come on baby, come and get me out
'''Harry:'''
Come on baby, cause I need you now

'''All:'''
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?


'''Harry:'''
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don’t want to feel alone

'''Zayn:'''
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

'''Harry:'''
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you, woah oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18

'''Niall:'''
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we’d be fine

'''Liam:'''
So pour me a drink oh love, 
Let’s split the night wide open and we’ll see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion

'''Zayn:'''
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

'''All:'''
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you, ooh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18

'''Niall:'''
When we were 18
Oh lord, when we were 18

'''Zayn:'''
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

'''Louis:'''
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing

'''All:'''
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
'''Niall:'''
I want a love like you made me feel
'''Harry:'''
When we were 18



'''Liam:'''
(Hey hey, Oh no no)

Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)

'''Harry:'''
She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake"
That her love is made up
No, no no no

'''Niall:'''
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty 
Let's pray we stay young
Stay made of lightning

'''Zayn:'''
Am I the only,
Only believer?
'''All:'''
There's something happening here
There's something happening here
'''Zayn:'''
The only
Only believer
'''All:'''
(There's something happening here,
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too)

'''Liam:'''
I get down, I get down, I get down 
On my knees for ya
I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees
I get down on my knees for you

'''Louis:'''
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)

'''Niall:'''
She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake"
That her love is made up
No, no no no

'''Harry:'''
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
'''Louis:'''
Let's pray we stay young
Stay made of lightning

'''Zayn:'''
Am I the only,
Only believer?

'''Liam:'''
I get down, I get down, I get down 
On my knees for ya
'''Niall:'''
I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees
I get down on my knees for you


'''Niall:'''
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind
Oh, every time
'''Harry:'''
And I know in my heart, you're not a constant star

'''Harry:'''
And yeah I’ve let you use me from that day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your 
Fool’s gold
And I knew that you would turn it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your 
Fool’s gold

'''Liam:'''
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me
'''Louis:'''
And I know in my heart, you’re just a moving part

'''Harry:'''
And yeah I’ve let you use me from that day that we first met
But I'm not done yet falling for your
Fool’s gold
And I knew that you would turn it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your
Fool’s gold 

'''Zayn:'''
Yeah I know your love’s not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel

'''Harry:'''
And yeah I’ve let you use me from that day that we first met
But I'm not done yet falling for your
Fool’s gold
And I knew that you would turn it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your
Fool’s gold, 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh


'''Zayn:'''
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had
She's showing off

'''Liam:'''
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

'''Harry:'''
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

'''Louis:'''
Chasing it tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop

'''Niall:'''
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

'''Harry:'''
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you 

'''Zayn:'''
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost

'''Harry:'''
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you


'''Niall:'''
Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick’s not enough
'''Harry:'''
Sleep, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

'''Louis:'''
Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control

'''Liam:'''
Taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
'''Harry:'''
In the heat where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

'''Louis:'''
Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control

'''Zayn:'''
Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfume’s holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
I devour
Lying here I count the hours

'''Louis:'''
Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control
No control
No control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control


'''Harry:'''
I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
Something deep inside me, I can't give up,
I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
I'll roll and I'll roll 'till I'm out of luck
Yeah, I'll roll and I'll roll 'till I'm out of luck,

'''Niall:'''
I'm feeling something deep inside,
Hotter than a jet stream burning up,
I've got a feeling deep inside,
It's taking, it's taking all I've got, 
Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I've got,

'''All:'''
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
'''Liam:'''
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you were fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.

'''Louis:'''
I think I'm gonna win this time,
Riding on the wind and I won't give up,
I think I'm gonna win this time,
I'll roll and I'll roll, 'till I change my luck
Yeah, I'll roll and I'll roll, 'till I change my luck,

'''All:'''
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
'''Zayn:'''
It's been so long, it's been so long, you must be fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do,

'''All:'''
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
'''Zayn:'''
It's been so long, it's been so long, 
'''Harry:'''
Maybe you were fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.


'''Niall:'''
Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?
'''Louis:'''
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?

'''Zayn:'''
We keep taking turns
Will we ever learn?

'''Harry:'''
All spaces between us
Keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach you
Even though I try
Spaces between us
Hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless
And I don't know why
'''Niall:'''
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

'''Liam:'''
Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?
'''Louis:'''
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made?

'''Harry:'''
All spaces between us
Keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach you
Even though I try
Spaces between us
Hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless
And I don't know why
'''Liam:'''
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

'''Zayn:'''
We keep taking turns 
Will we ever learn?
When will we learn?

'''Harry:'''
All spaces between us
Keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach you
Even though I try
Spaces between us
Hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless
And I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

'''Niall:'''
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us


'''Harry:'''
Who’s that shadow holding me hostage?
I’ve been here for days
Who’s this whisper telling me that I’m
Never gonna get away?

'''Zayn:'''
I know they’ll be coming 
To find me soon
But I fear I’m getting
Used to being held by you

'''Harry:'''
Baby look what you've done to me 
Baby look what you've done now 
Baby I’ll never leave 
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I’ll never leave 
If you keep holding me this way

'''Louis:'''
Who’s this man that’s holding your hand
And talking ‘bout your eyes
Used to sing about being free but
Now he’s changed his mind

'''Niall:'''
I know they’ll be coming 
To find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome 
Is in your room
Yeah I fell for you!

'''Harry:'''
Baby look what you've done to me 
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I’ll never leave 
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tight now
Baby I’ll never leave 
If you keep holding me this way

'''Liam:'''
All my life I’ve been on my own
I used the light to guide me home
And now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

'''All:'''
Look what you've done to me
'''Harry:'''
Baby look what you've done, done
Baby look what you've done to me 
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I’ll never leave 
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me 
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I’ll never leave 
If you keep holding me this way


'''Harry:'''
I know you say
That you don’t like it complicated
That we should try keep it simple
But love is never ever simple, no

'''Louis:'''
Someday 
You’re gonna see the things that I see
You’re gonna want the air that I breathe
You’re gonna wish you never left me

'''All:'''
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?
'''Harry:'''
If we’re never coming back down
Yeah we’re looking down on the clouds

'''Liam:'''
I know you say
That you don’t like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
But love is always, always changing, woah

'''Zayn:'''
Someday 
You’re gonna see the things that I see
You’re gonna want air that I breathe
You’re gonna wish you never left me

'''All:'''
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?
'''Harry:'''
If we’re never coming back down
Yeah we’re looking down on the clouds

'''Niall:'''
And we go
And we go
And we go
And we don’t stop

But we don’t
No we don’t 
No we don’t
Never go up

And we go
And we go
And we go
And we don’t stop

But we don’t
No we don’t 
No we don’t
Never go up

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?

Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?

Here we go again 
Another go round for all of my friends 
Another night stop will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another night stop will it ever end?


'''Harry:'''
Watching you get dressed messes with my head
Take that bag off your shoulder
Come get back in bed, we still got time left
This don't have to be over

'''Niall:'''
And you'd say it's hard to keep a secret
Girl don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
One weekend, I promise that I'll never tell

'''Liam:'''
You should probably stay, probably stay, a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home
You should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home
Don’t go, it’s not the same when you go
And it’s not good to be all alone
So you should probably stay, here with me, a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home

'''Zayn:'''
Don’t play innocent, I know what you meant
When you said you’d come over
'''Niall:'''
Are we way past that, playing hard to get?
We did that when we were younger

'''Louis:'''
And you say it’s hard to keep a secret
Girl don’t leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
One weekend, I promise that I’ll never tell

'''Liam:'''
You should probably stay, probably stay, a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home
You should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home
Don’t go, it’s not the same when you go
And it’s not good to be all alone
Don't go, it's not the same when you go
Come and let me change your ticket home

'''Zayn:'''
Why don’t we take some time?
Why don’t we take just a little more time?
Why don’t we make it right?
Girl, I don’t wanna say goodbye?

'''Liam:'''
You should probably stay, probably stay, a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home
You should probably stay, here with me a couple more days
Come and let me change your ticket home
Don’t go, it’s not the same when you go
And it’s not good to be all alone
Don't go, it's not the same when you go
Come and let me change your ticket home


'''All:'''
Tell me you believe in love
It's not an illusion

'''Liam:'''
I've been thinking about the nights and the dangerous tricks
People play on the eyes of the innocent
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them

'''Harry:'''
But believe me I'm not trying to deceive you
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake

'''Zayn:'''
No baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me

No baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

'''Liam:'''
You don't ever have to worry about me, about how the cards fall, 
I'm all that you need tonight
I would never turn your heart into broken parts
You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes

'''Louis:'''
Can't you see it?
I'm not trying to mislead ya
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake

'''Zayn:'''
No baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me

No baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

'''Niall:'''
You can tie me up in chains
You can throw away the key
But there's no trap doors
I'm not gonna leave
You're the truth I can't explain
You're the only one I see
It's not an illusion to me

'''Zayn:'''
No baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me

No baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion


'''Liam:'''
Once in a lifetime
It's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even a landslide or riptide
Could take it all away

'''Harry:'''
Somehow it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
It sounds like you

'''All:'''
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side

'''Louis:'''
Once in a lifetime
It's just right and we are always safe
'''Niall:'''
Not even the bad guys and the dark nights 
Could take it all away

'''Louis:'''
Somehow it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
'''Niall:'''
Out loud, someone's calling my name
And it sounds like you

'''All:'''
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side

'''Liam:'''
Once in a lifetime
You were mine


'''Niall:'''
When I'm fat and old
And my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause I move a little slow
When I dance

'''Liam:'''
I can count on you
After all that we've been through
'Cause I know that you'll always understand

'''All:'''
I won't act my age
No, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you

'''Louis:'''
When I'm fat and old
And my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause the stories that I've told
I tell again and again

'''Zayn:'''
I can count on you
After all we got up to
'Cause I know that you truly understand

'''All:'''
I won't act my age
No, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age
No, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too

'''Harry:'''
When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling out
We'll still stay up 'til morning
We'll throw an after party

'''All:'''
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I won't act my age
No, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age
No, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too


'''Liam:'''
Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies,
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

'''Harry:'''
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man.

'''All:'''
Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young,
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young.

'''Niall:'''
Some are like water, some are like the heat,
Some are like the melody and some are the beat,
But sooner or later they all will be gone,
Why don't they stay young?

'''Harry:'''
It's hard to get old without a cause,
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,
And diamonds are forever.

'''All:'''
Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young,
Do you really want to live forever,
Forever, or never?

Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young
Do you really want to live forever,
Forever, or never?

'''Liam:'''
So many adventures couldn't happen today,
So many songs we forgot to play,
So many dreams swinging out of the blue,
We let 'em come true.

'''Harry:'''
Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young,
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never?

'''All:'''
Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young 
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never?

Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never?

Forever young,
I wanna be, forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young...


Oh oh oh oh

There was a time,
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell ya,
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can´t explain,
But there´s something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It´s that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can´t describe
But there´s something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart,
In all honesty
I´m speechless and I don’t know where to start

And I can´t explain
But there´s something about the way you look tonight
Oh takes my breath away
It’s that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can´t describe
But there´s something about the way you look tonight,
Takes my breath away,
The way you look tonight.


I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around, she was dignified
Showed me what it was to cry
You couldn't be that girl i adored
You don't seem to know or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore

There's nothing left, I used to cry
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

You're a little late
I'm already torn (I'm already torn)

There's nothing left
I used to cry
Inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine I'm torn
Nothing's fine I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and i am shamed
Lying broken on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn (I'm already I'm already torn)
Torn
Oh torn

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow!)

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide til' we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me *Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you


Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won't remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
It'll show me your shadow
I'm in my place
Hope you remember
When summer's gone
I'll still sing a song
Of you in September
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

These words I say mean
You're so amazing
I've noticed lately
I need you, maybe

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so


Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you'd breathe me
'Til you're not feeling sure 
Everything will brighten up 
If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened I'll make it disappear 

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now

When I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you 

Sunny days
That left my skin blood red
And you squeeze me 
'Til these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This loves too overrated
See what's going on, on

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now

When I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
Now I'm missing you
I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
I thought I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

And I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too


The city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens beat through my window cill,
I can't close my eyes,
Don't control what I'm into.,

This town is alive,
With lights that blind keep me awake,
Put my hood up, unlace and tie,
The street fills my mind,
Don't control what I'm into.,

London calls me a stranger,
A traveller Ohoohohh,
This is now my home, My home,
Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.,

The pavement is my friend,
It'll take me where I need to go,
If I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to.,

[Verse]
The shop across the road,
It fills my needs and keeps me company,
When I need it,
Voices beat through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,

Past to-mor-roow.,

London calls me a stranger,
A traveller Ohoohohh,
This is now my home, My home,
Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.,

And my lungs hurt,
And my ears bled,
With the sounds of the city life,
Echoed in my head,
Do I need this, To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I,
Need to move alone.

London calls me a stranger,
This is now my home, Home,

Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.  [x2]


You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
See, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes and then I saw Alice staring back at me
And I will try to find another one who's suited to me
As well as her

I've moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine, I was hers and all that's in between
When she would cry, I would shelter her and keep her
From the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear, woah

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep then I might learn
If you scar and leave me like sunburn

Don't drop me in, it's not my time
If you cut deep then I might learn
You scarred and left me, like sunburn

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you


You and I
Two of a mind
This love's
One of a kind
You and I
We're drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
Learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
We're lifted
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too? (4x)


The rain wont stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

What I need to know
Is if you love me and I 
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you call
If you want me when you call

We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call

We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away

We are waving (and what I need to know)
We are waving (is if you love me and I)
We are waving (really need to know)
We are waving (if you need me when you call)
We are waving (what I need to know)
We are waving (is if you love me an I)
We are waving (really need to know)
We are waving (if you need me when you call)

What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call


Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I'm next to you

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
See where we land

It's been this way since we were young
We'll fight and then make up
I'll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
And see where we land (2x)


She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong 
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong

Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

'Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand 
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight


I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
As strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork but harder to read

Patience's my enemy
Loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh she, knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy

Loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh she, knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand she already understands everything
"Won't you stay" she says
And she already knows how it goes 
And where she stands I'll stay, anyway

'Cause she knows me so well
Oh she, knows me like I know myself 
Oh she, knows me so well 
Oh she, knows me like I know myself
I know myself

Oh she, knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself


Oooh ooh ooh
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through, this world alone
There's no sickness, toil or danger
And that bright laight to which i go
And i'm going there to see my mother
And i'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going over home now

Hey eÃ½ ey yeah
Mmmm
Ooohhh

I know dark clouds will gather me
I know my way's rough and steep
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
And i know my way's rough and steep
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going over home now

Coz i am a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through, this world alone
There's no sickness, toil or danger
And that bright laight to which i go
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going home now


I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been 'ere before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes

Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
I stumble and fall with the head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore, now it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said that we'll be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you

Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great but everything's short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And everything I say seems to always sound awkward

Like our last kiss, it was perfect
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying every day that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore, now it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh, you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down, oh
And I'm thinking that I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
I keep looking around, to make sure I'm not
The only one to feel low

Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied


Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow!)

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you


White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die 


I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse that I made up
Tell you the truth that I want
Didn't kill me. It never made me stronger at all

Love will scare your makeup
Lip sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
And no, I'll never hold you like I used to

But the house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on the heart to beating
'Cos you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

Should I?, Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends
Though I know you’ll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don’t heal like before
And you don’t hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band’s name
I know I can’t heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I?, Should I?
Maybe I’ll get drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself, I’m here again
All by myself, you know I’ll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I’m just drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
I’ll be drunk again
To feel a little love

My mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet

And I see it in your movements tonight
And if we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down-low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down now

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer 
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again

I see it in your movements tonight
And if we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll keep it on the down-low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down


I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand, 
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know 
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love 
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say

I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'ma be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know 
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love 
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up


You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months you're brought to life

And I'll whisper quietly
And give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only, you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon open wide
A small bump, in four months
You'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
And tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

Then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
When you're half asleep I'll leave you be
Right in front of me, for a couple weeks
So I could keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
'Round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months, then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why 



This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one that made me lose it all
You are the the start of something new 

And I'll throw it all away
Watched you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth I will stand on
You are the words I will sing

And I'd thrown it all away
Watched you fall into his arms again
And I'd thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now

And take me back
And take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back home

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new


The city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens beat through my window cill,
I can't close my eyes,
Don't control what I'm into.,

This town is alive,
With lights that blind keep me awake,
Put my hood up, unlace and tie,
The street fills my mind,
Don't control what I'm into.,

London calls me a stranger,
A traveller Ohoohohh,
This is now my home, My home,
Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.,

The pavement is my friend,
It'll take me where I need to go,
If I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to.,

[Verse]
The shop across the road,
It fills my needs and keeps me company,
When I need it,
Voices beat through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,

Past to-mor-roow.,

London calls me a stranger,
A traveller Ohoohohh,
This is now my home, My home,
Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.,

And my lungs hurt,
And my ears bled,
With the sounds of the city life,
Echoed in my head,
Do I need this, To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I,
Need to move alone.

London calls me a stranger,
This is now my home, Home,

Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.  [x2]


I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind, it's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right, we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's a dark and cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya and I'll keep you
Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now


Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow!)

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you


Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
Hold me in your arms

Your heart's against my chest
Lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you

So hold you close
To help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love


Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, give me love

Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover

Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
(Love me, love me, love me)

Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
(Give me love)
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
(Give me love)
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
(Give me love, love me)
Mm-my, my, mm-my, my, mm-my, my, give me love, lover
(Give me love)

My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
My, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love



Another day another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated

Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
Its not complicated

Another life that's gone to waste 
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

Is it only wonder or do birds still sing for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony places the song that carries you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay 

Is it any wonder that the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me

Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh, ooh oh

Touch down 
Like a seven four seven 
Stay out and we'll live forever now


If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come in side for a little lie down with me
And if we fall asleep it would be the worst thing.
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if i lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, ohh

But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet 
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
And i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew 
We can lay down, so i'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if i wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and i'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet 
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.

And i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

My little bird

My little bird

And of all this thing i'm sure of, i'm not quite certain of your love
You made scream but then i made you cry when i left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet 
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
But i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa

My little bird

My little bird

Your my little bird...


A smoke alarm went off at night, 
I woke up wipe the sleep out of my eye,
She left a note "I'll be back in five", 
Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive,

And I was told to put my job in front of you,
But it won't hold me like you do.

(Chorus)
But I do it for the love, 
Waiting on the gold rush, 
Keep it on the edge, 
Smoking on a roll-up, 
When I see my friends, 
All they say is "Hold up, 
Ed, remember the time, 
When we were in school, 
listening to grown-ups, 
Didn't learn a thing, 
But then again you know what, 
You know how to sing, 
But you don't know anything other than that, 
So maybe you should learn to love her, 
Like, like the way, 
And maybe you should learn to love her, 
Like, like the way, 
And maybe you should learn to love her, 
Like, like the way, 
And maybe you should learn to love her, 
Like, like the way you wanna be loved."

I never told her that I liked, 
The way she dances, slightly out of time, 
And pretends she knows the words, 
To a song she never heard, 
But I tell her all the time,

Well, I was told to put my job in front of you, 
But it won't hold me like you do.

Chorus 2x


You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
See, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes and then I saw Alice staring back at me
And I will try to find another one who's suited to me
As well as her

I've moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine, I was hers and all that's in between
When she would cry, I would shelter her and keep her
From the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you and I want to see you here
Beside me, dear, but things aren't clear, woah

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep then I might learn
If you scar and leave me like sunburn

Don't drop me in, it's not my time
If you cut deep then I might learn
You scarred and left me, like sunburn

When we never even tried, we never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful, whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you


You give me life
Like lots of oxygen
You treat me like
I was in love again
And I hold you tight
Tight enough to know
That you are mine
I'd never let you go

And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss
So let it out
Let it out, now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

You speak me to me
Behind your darkening stare
And you let me be
As if I wasn't there
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex 
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart
You see we were just like glue

It's you I miss

And it's you I miss
So let it out
Let it out, now
I let it out
I let it out, now, now. 

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn part
You see we were just like glue

We're like glue 

So let it out
Let it out, now
Let it out
Let it out, now, now

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart 
You see we were just like glue


Could I wake up next to you
When we're hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired 
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on

Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my food for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

Your my little bird...


She’s reinventing loving me
When we’re resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5.01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I’m way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it’s cold outside, again

And we’re both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I’ll take ya
But I’d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

When the morning comes
We’re not watching Formula I
It’s not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain’t too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it’s cold outside, again
And we’re still so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I’ll take ya
But I’d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

And it feels like I’m flying
And it feels like
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York
That is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio
Passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want
Say the word, and I’ll take ya
But I’d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa
On the sofa, with you


Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she's a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, then I'll tell her myself

And we've got love in us
So if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I don't really dance
So I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that's alright
I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don't mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you're wearing
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

She's like the fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she's all I need

Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself


I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet 
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly 
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

Teach my skin 
Those new tricks
Warm me up 
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You're the one
To help me
Get to sleep

And hold me tight

Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly 
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

It's only been 
One night of love
And maybe 
That is not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

It's only been 
One night of love
And maybe 
That's not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes


The city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens beat through my window cill,
I can't close my eyes,
Don't control what I'm into.,

This town is alive,
With lights that blind keep me awake,
Put my hood up, unlace and tie,
The street fills my mind,
Don't control what I'm into.,

London calls me a stranger,
A traveller Ohoohohh,
This is now my home, My home,
Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.,

The pavement is my friend,
It'll take me where I need to go,
If I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to.,

[Verse]
The shop across the road,
It fills my needs and keeps me company,
When I need it,
Voices beat through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,

Past to-mor-roow.,

London calls me a stranger,
A traveller Ohoohohh,
This is now my home, My home,
Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.,

And my lungs hurt,
And my ears bled,
With the sounds of the city life,
Echoed in my head,
Do I need this, To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I,
Need to move alone.

London calls me a stranger,
This is now my home, Home,

Oh Woah,
Burning on the back street,
Oh Woah,
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat,
Oh Woah,
And I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't upto you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.  [x2]


I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet 
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly

ED
Mmmmm

I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves

I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close

DEVLIN
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

CHORUS
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be..

The times i'm living in lately.

ED
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they wont slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone 
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die.

DEVLIN
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge, 
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged ,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake.

CHORUS 
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be.. x4
The times i'm living in lately.


The thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid but not near ones feather than limits I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute the thoughts I have could be dark ones even be smart ones, you know I'm going to have a couple straight from the heart once, tell you what I think I will until I depart mum it's you that I live for I'm the first and the last ones,I love you lots what better than thinking about the ones you love nothing much when your thinking about the ones you love I feel the same when I'm on the floor see the sun above unconditional Like


Hmm let me go,
To see my family.
Please Father let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

I don't know about days gone,
But round here nobody lives twice.
When your gone, your gone, without no bye,
Because only a judge can give you life.
This is my advice,
Trust me, I nearly lost my life.
3 weeks after I got this rhyme,
It seems like I had too much wine.
Which that I I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to the ? booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one.
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one.
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one.
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired.
But I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing.
No motion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going.
Woke up,
Lorry,
Flash,
Panic,
Break,
Skid,
Crash,
Skidded,
More,
Bang,
Smash,
Out,
Cold,
Ribs,
Cracked,
Ouch.
I was in so much pain,
Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane.
Baffled, didn't even know my name.
Fainted, too much shock in my brain.
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,
Trying to get up but fainted again.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out.

I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing.
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in.
I can hear all of the angels singing.

But when it stopped humming,
My brain turned on, stared running.
Still in pain, but it started numbing,
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning.
I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.
But I was left with a permanent problem,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running.
I used the first air kit like a drum set,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming.
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in.
Never done dream for a while,
The black plan was blocked,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.
They say tomorrow never dies,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam.
You can try beg for another,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family.
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul.


Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me
But now it's a part
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, while the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think, JME just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this,
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair. Straight,
Who can tell me different? Look at me, determined,
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this

[Chorus]
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cos I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio, but go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising the roof

Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the bassline, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?

Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh

Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh


(Verse 1 - Mikill Pane)

Listen
Little lady, this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
It's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you no your legs will ache if you try
& you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington were they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman
The pimp see's you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 
'cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him
'cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

(Chorus - Ed Sheeran)

She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
& she don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly.

(Verse 2 - Mikill Pane)

Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injurys you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up
A little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stiched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise if you stared him in the face anyway
'cos all the heroin is making you age
But your a heroin for taking the strain of being a prostitue and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using moneygram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know your never coming back
She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state the summer fans
See that you came to London to get pimped by your Uncle, damn.

(Chorus - Ed Sheeran)

She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
& she don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and

Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes & hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight,
Straight down the line.

(Verse 3 - Mikill Pane)

Little lady, your trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear
Your sitting facing the detective, oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it, 
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
Your causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The coppers trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, who you working for?
He's talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore
Your having a conversation you could be murdered for
Your learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it
He's useless if your gonna be stupid
'cos an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, your on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says 'where you been bitch? I wanna know.'
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your albibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Merc in the street.
Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday

(Chorus - Ed Sheeran)

& We're all under the upper hand
& go mad for a couple grams
& we don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'Cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly.


[ghetts]
I'm in so deep Omar Eds can relate to my situation its so real, 
Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow
Im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
Oh-o-oh
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track

[ed sheeran]
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
Youuuuu won't drown me out

[ghetts]
You can't ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around 6'1, 10 stone
I never seen someone drown with insufficient amount of liquid in my lungs 

A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking? Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking?
I'm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it's in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this aint no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive.

[ed sheeran]
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me out

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me out.


They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's never been 
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading. 

Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in, 
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms, 
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training, 
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception, cause they try to hit misses with my direction, 
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night, 
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death, 
But I hear shit because I am deaf

Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in, 
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia 
Now, I Mr hard worker, 
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck, 
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish, thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress 

Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in, 
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Watching me!


Hey can you hear me I was just wanting to let you know hmm

I hope you can hear what I write to you how can I say goodbye to you when I'm a life that came out of a life that was inside of you I got to respect the way you provided food for the whole fam you came over in a rush a support


Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one


Ooh I’m a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not he end
I can’t work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you’re my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I’m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can’t shake this feeling now
We’re going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I’ve only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you’re my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I’m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I’ve loved my lover
For how long I’ve loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I’ve loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I’ve loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I’ve loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I’ve loved my lover
For how long, long I’ve loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I’ve loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I’ve loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I’ve loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I’ve loved my lover


It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Louder!
Sing!

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing "[[Rihanna:We_Found_Love|We Found Love]]" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!
Louder!
Sing!

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing!


I met this girl late last year
She said "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out [[Aretha Franklin|Aretha]], all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe


I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read these taxes while the speakers play
I’ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high, two cars, we needed no breathe
We used each other’s edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your wake cards
We can all be loved the way God made us
And time’s the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
‘Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You’d be wearing my hood
With jewels, strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
Cause every day when I was a baby
Don’t you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Panic
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then you vanish
Back to borrow all of the ‘queltics’ are disappearing
You call me selfish, I don’t understand
But I can’t help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But you’ll be in between forever
So I guess we’ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I’m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we kinda need to deal with the pain
We need to get on the plane
But in the day we’ll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
‘Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won’t you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
‘Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now


Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that we're never repeating ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, there'll be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can keep me
Inside the necklace you bought when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, there'll be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm going, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home


I’ve been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh
No no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I’ve been looking for a lover
Thought I’d find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I’ll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I’ve done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh
No no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line...

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted


You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back


I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don’t wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna run away
Run away with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It’s been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don’t wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say cause he knows
I’ll just run away and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen light
I'd tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I’m gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it’s morning, go

How long you leavin'?
Well dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It’s been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way
But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don’t wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say cause he knows
I’ll just run away in the overnight

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
Cause I packed my clothes up
My dad was a man without plans of attack and tends to show that
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
I guess that God knows that
I don’t wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don’t wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say cause he knows
I’ll just run away and be on my own


Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore


When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's ever green
Baby your smile forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are


Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you’re lying in the bed again
Either way I’ll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, “Son,
It’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face,
And you’re not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say…

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they’re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh.
 
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain.
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, “Son,
It’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face,
And you’re not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say…

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they’re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh.'
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love

And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

(And all my brothers and my sisters yeah)

And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love


I'm not a rapper; I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
To make from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a Movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation
If I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now...

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news,
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,
Whispering everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song,
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong,
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree,
Singing for the masses,
Rubber dinghy rapids,
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic,
I'm battling for respect,
I don't know if I'll have it,
This songs from the heart,
Cover the planet
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect,
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene,
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change,
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again,
Living life on the edge,
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely,
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out;
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love,
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow


I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You’ll be sinking in
So we’ll learn to swim in the ocean
You made to hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you’ll be floating away
And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes

I still taste salt water
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up
I’ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The saltedness won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I’m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I’m drowning in the ocean you made

The saltedness won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes


It’s alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don’t wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you’re alive
It’s alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven’t tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you’re giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

It’s alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
It’s alright to say that death’s the only thing you haven’t tried
But just for today hold on

So live life like you’re giving all
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path
And hold on


Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
Into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine
For the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oo oo ooo ooooooo (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside


It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing "[[Snow Patrol:Chasing Cars|Chasing Cars]]" and I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America


Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
Into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine
For the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oo oo ooo ooooooo (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside


It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing "[[Snow Patrol:Chasing Cars|Chasing Cars]]" and I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars
From America


When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To purify pure as the canes
Even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears bring me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain

And the seas are full of water
That stop by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

So let the claps fill with thunderous applause
And let thy death be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change


Shock, horror, i'm down
Lost, your not around
There's a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on autopilot 
And my tongues gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to me

I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe when i made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaaid
That i miss you
That i miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I'm just in on a fence of how it used to be
These three words, are aching
Constrict them, suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture i'm painting
And my belly's sick to its stomach
When i remember all the times he was with you 

When you laid it dowwwn
When you laid down, next to me

I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe when i made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaaid
That i miss you, more then i let on
I kissed you, far to long
I'll let go, as soon as you do
See i know, were not through

I don't know when i lost my mind
maybe when i made you mine
Wooooooah ohhhhhh
I dont know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaid
That I miss you
That i miss you
Wooooaahhh 

I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaaaid
That i miss you


Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different "kind"
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
Now all your love is wasted?
Then who the hell was I?
Now I'm breaking at the bridges
And at the end of all your lines

(2x)
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?


My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever could speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

We were born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well

A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny

Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life


In hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you more than you will know

Shine a light, just one side
To think again that you're mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no were left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Oh, I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart

But all the night
Sky blue, stars are bright
Shine through, like you
And I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no were left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Tell me that there's no were left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Now that I have captured your attention
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. T say I'm ready for inspection
Show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long

Breathe me in, breathe me out

Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name, I'll never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Don't be afraid, close your eyes
Let me take you to places you've never been tonight

If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
It's dead steady, there's falling and flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just stars, dance

If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away...just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever


Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, your eyes
It's the end of the night
But the beginning of time, for you and I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
Save the day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
Save the day

Yeah we're still wide awake
Got me losing my mind, my mind
No, it's never too late,
Put your lips on mine
In the burning sunlight, I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day

And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

I look at you, and all I wanna do, is just disappear
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get out of here
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know my heart

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover,
You don't need no other lover
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover


''Hey babe it's me, I just wanted to call to tell you that
I love you so so so so much,
Just wanted to let you know that you are my princess,
You are worthy of all of the love in the world,
You are the love of my life.''

Now's all we got,
And time can't be bought,
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember

You said you loved me,
I said I loved you back,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

All your promises,
And all them plans we had,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

The trips we dream of takin',
The tags left on the map,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing,
When all we did was laugh,
What happened? what happened?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

Break down the walls,
Let heaven in,
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again,
We used to be inseparable,
I used to think that I was irreplaceable,
We lit the whole world up,
Before we blew it up,
I just don't know how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember 
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

Since jamming with the dark side
I wanna be your bad girl
You bring out my wild side
Your eyes your lips your touch
His talk, sadistic rush, your sexy kinda swag
The best i've ever had

Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up but im loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody, nobody doe-doe-doe

All I need is love
That's what you give, I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That's what I feel when your skin's on mine

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

All I need is true
That's what you are
When everything's alright
All I need is here
Right where you are, you're every reason why

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire
Cause you set me up on fire
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better



In the dark we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from the world outside we know
In your lips I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from our world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
Run away from the world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And it's my favorite part

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you


You're so hot (not?)
But if I can be honest
Baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool (not?)
But if you didn't notice
You got me playing a fool
With you
Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way

You're so... you (ew, grows)
But there's something about ya
It's making me feel like I do
With you
Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be true
We will
I'm all about you
If it's real
You got me sick
Cause I'm not letting go

We will never change
It ain't that a love but it I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
Across the line
Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
It ain't that a love but I like it that way.


(What the heart wants...)
(The heart wants...)
(What the heart wants...)

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby...

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away...just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever


Now that I have captured your attention
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. T say I'm ready for inspection
Show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
Breathe me in, breathe me out
No stop until the morning
Breathe me in, breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah
Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
Breathe me in, breathe me out
No stop until the morning
Breathe me in, breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it
For it, for it
Yeah

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song


Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bom bom
Cada vez, cada vez que lo veo pasar
Mi corazo se enloquece
Y me empieza a palpitar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
No lo puedo controlar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
Y me empieza a cantar
Me canta asi

Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi bom bom

Cada vez, cada vez que lo oigo hablar
Me tiemblan hasta las piernas
Y el corazon igual
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
No lo puedo controlar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
Y me empieza a cantar
Me canta asi

Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi bom bom

Cuando escucho esta canción
Mi corazon quiere cantar así
Me canta así, me canta a ti
Cada vez que lo veo pasar
Mi corazon se enloquece
Cada vez que lo veo pasar
Y me empieza a palpitar
Así, así


Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name

Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic
Glide through your life

A sprinkle of pixie dust
Circles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free
To spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart

Fly to the heights of all you can be
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free
To spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart



Disappear! 

I remember the first time 
But it wasn't the last time that you told me that 
You'd take me back 
So I'm still wondering why 
It was ever a question 
Should've learned my lesson 
I keep coming back 
Like a heart attack 
That's always breaking 

I can't let you vanish 
There's no magic 
When you're gone 

You say you don't need me 
You say there's something beneath me 
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
I don't wanna hear it 
I don't wanna believe it 
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh 
Disappear 

I don't wanna be lonely 
But you were always the only one 
Who cast the spell 
And make it feel like 
All of this was real 
Nothing but an illusion 
But I'm not gonna lose ya 
So just do your trick 
And make it quick 
Cause I'm pretending 

I can't let you vanish 
There's no magic 
When you're gone 

You say you don't need me 
You say there's something beneath me 
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
I don't wanna hear it 
I don't wanna believe it 
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh 
Disappear 

Don't Go!

I can't let you vanish 
There's no magic 
When you're gone 

Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh 
Disappear 

You say you don't need me 
You say there's something beneath me 
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
I don't wanna hear it 
I don't wanna believe it 
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh 
Disappear 

Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh 
Disappear

Don't Go! 





Well you know everything's gonna be a breeze
That the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease

(Yes please)

When you might find out
It'll go to your head
When you write a report
On a book you never read
With the snap of your fingers
You can make your bed
That's what I said

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted
In your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble
If you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want
By the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems



Oh, oh, oh,
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!

I've never been awake,
I've never seen a day break,
Leaning on my pillow in the morning.
A lazy day in bed, music in my head,
Crazy music playing in the morning
Light!

Oh, oh, oh,
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!

I love a sunny day,
A dream of far away,
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning.
I've never been awake,
I've never seen a day break,
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Light!

Oh, oh, oh,
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!

Oh, oh, oh,
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know,
Never believe it's not so!

Never believe…


Just drive I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever for you to get
Yourself together, I rather be alone

I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical

Wish I could blink and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you, make it all come true

You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change
See my heart, maybe broken
But that won't stop me hoping

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical

Wish I could blink and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you, make it all come true

I just wanna know what we should've done
When I figured out what we could've become
'Cause I know in my heart I know I'm not over you

I just wanna go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us, whoa

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical

Wish I could blink and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you, make it all come true

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical

Wish I could blink and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you, make it all come true


Don't like waiting 
Don't like waiting
Let's go right now
Gotta' hit the ground
Dancing 'fore the music
Slows down

What I'm sayin', what I'm sayin'
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level
This is the remix

Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor

Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Shake it up

Break it down 
Break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancin' with me
It's like we go MIA

Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Sh-sh-sh-shake it up
You gotta change it up
And if the day's not right
Just brush it off tonight
Put on the attitude
You're in my pocket mood
And when you've had enough
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up
Shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up






You got my eye
And I'm tryin' to holla at ya
You're walking by

You got me floatin' ten feet
Off the ground

And I can't come down
My heart's pumpin'
And it's workin' overtime
I got the crazy butterflies
We're doin' it right
When we work together
I'll give up my side
It don't get better
If you want my team
Gotta figure it out
It's you and me
No doubt,

My new boy used to be a model

Bidi bidi bom bom

Cada vez, cada vez que lo veo pasar
Mi corazo se enloquece
Y me empieza a palpitar
Bidi bidi bom bom
Y se emociona, ya no razona
No lo puedo controlar

Y se emociona, ya no razona
Y me empieza a cantar
Me canta asi

Mi corazon se enloquece
Cada vez que lo veo pasar
Y me empieza a palpitar
Así, así




Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh
Look out for Cruella De Vil

Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you
No evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil

The curl of her lips
The ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil...

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil...

Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh

This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She 'outta be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
Yeah!

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil...

Oooh, ooh oh oh, oooh oh
(oooh oh, oooh oh, oooh oh, oooh oh)

At first you think Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You've come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a ROOOOOOOCK!

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will

Look out for Cruella De Vil



Por ti me olvide de quien yo era en realidad
Contigo me quede, como un diamante sin brillar
No quiero ser así, espejo de tu vanidad
Prefiero ser de mí
Sin nada que temer, nada que cambiar

Na na na
Yo me siento así
Bella y auténtica
Na na na
No seré por ti
Una fuerte mental, no no

[Chorus]
Dices, que soy imperfecta,
Que tu eres mi dueño,
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo.
Dices que hablo cosas tontas,
Que no te merezco,
Quien te crees que eres, dime quien.

Te pido por favor,
Que no me quieras controlar,
Entregame tu amor,
Sin condiciones nada mas.
Permíteme vivir, soñando ésta realidad
No ves que soy asi, distinta sin igual

Na na na
Yo me siento así
Bella y auténtica
Na na na
No seré por ti

Una fuerte mental, no no

[Chorus]

Dices que soy una niña,
Que me tienen consentida.
Dices que soy diferente,
Ciertamente, ciertamente.
Soy lo que me gusta ser,
No me intentes detener.
Mírame bien, no estoy hecha de papel.
Dices!

[Chorus]

Eue soy imperfecta,
Que tu eres mi dueño,
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo.
Dices que hablo cosas tontas,
Que no te merezco,
Quien te crees que eres, dime quien.


Hey hey hey hey

Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moving
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey soul sister, ain't that mister mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight

Hey hey hey hey

Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection, we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey soul sister, ain't that mister mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight

Well you can cut a rug
Watching you is the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me

Hey soul sister, ain't that mister mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey hey hey hey (tonight)
Hey hey hey hey (tonight)


You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS like a bitch
I would know

And you over think
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(But you)
But you don't really want to go

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be just like twins
So in sync, the same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring

I should know that
You're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(But you)
But you don't really want to go

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(But you)
But you don't really want to go

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down


You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind,
The conversation goes nowhere
Because you're never gonna take me there

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine,
I heard the rumors but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
Woah, I could live without you
Your smile, your eyes
The way you make me feel inside
I could live without you
But I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Oh

Oh, you make me so upset sometimes

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head
(Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you (it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you

My-My-My Dilemma




Hey, hey, hey!(la, la, la, la, la, la) 
Hey, hey, hey!(la, la, la, la, la, la) 

You come from here, I come from there 
You rock out in your room, I rock the world premiere 
We're more alike than anybody could ever tell (ever tell) 
Friday we're cool, Monday we're freaks 
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we can get out, let loose, and LOL (LOL) 

It may seems cliché for me to wanna say 
That you're not alone 
And you can call me uncool 
But it's a simple fact 
I've got you back 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Cuz we're one and the same 
We're anything but ordinary 
One and the same 
I think we're almost legendary 
You and me, the perfect team 
Chasing down the dream 
We're one and the same! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 

I'm kind of like you 
You're kind of like me 
We're in the same song 
And a different key 
It's got a rhythm that you and can get along (get along) 

It may seems cliché for me to wanna say 
For me to wanna say 
That you're not alone 
And you can call me uncool 
But it's a simple fact 
I still got you back 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Cuz we're one and the same 
We're anything but ordinary 
One and the same 
I think we're almost legendary 
You and me, the perfect team 
Shaking up the scene 
We're one and the same! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 

Cuz we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're so good momen-momentary
Cuz we're one
Yeah, yeah
Cuz we're one
Yeah, yeah
We're anything but ordinary
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
One and the same
Hey! Hey!!(la,la,la,la,la,la) 
Hey,hey,hey!



Happier times flashed through my mind
We both say it's over
And I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night

A sad sad serenade
Sad sad seranade
We almost got it right
A sad sad serenade
Sad seranade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade

I won't regret
What I won't forget
Memories and your number
Are all I have left
I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we both are to blame
I can't believe you didn't fight harder for me

Is a sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade

The more you love
The more it hurts
When it ends
When it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over and over
In your head
In your heart
Turn it up
Make it stop
Tonight all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

Is a sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade

A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade


Now that I have captured your attention 
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention 
Mr. T you say I’m ready for inspection 
Show me how you make a first impression 

Oh, oh 
Can we take it nice and slow, slow 
Break it down and drop it low, low 
Cause I just wanna party all night 
In the neon lights 
’til you can’t let me go 

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine 
All night long 
Baby, Slow Down the song 
And when it’s coming closer to the end hit rewind 
All night long 
Baby, Slow Down the song 

If you want me I’m accepting applications 
So long as we keep this record on rotation 
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth recitation 
Breathe me in, breathe me out 
So amazing 

Oh, oh 
Can we take it nice and slow, slow 
Break it down and drop it low, low 
Cause I just wanna party all night 
In the neon lights 
’til you can’t let me go 

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine 
All night long 
Baby, Slow Down the song 
And when it’s coming closer to the end hit rewind 
All night long 
Baby, Slow Down the song 

Breathe me in, breathe me out 
The music’s got me going 
Breathe me in, breathe me out 
No stop until the morning 
Breathe me in, breathe me out 
You know I’m ready for it 
For it, for it 
Yeah 

Breathe me in, breathe me out 
The music’s got me going 
Breathe me in, breathe me out 
No stop until the morning 
Breathe me in, breathe me out 
You know I’m ready for it 
For it, for it 
Yeah 

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine 
All night long 
Baby, Slow Down the song 
And when it’s coming closer to the end hit rewind 
All night long 
Baby, Slow Down the song

'''Замедли'''
<lyrics>
Теперь, когда я привлекла твое внимание, 
Я хочу похитить тебя, чтобы мы вместе сдались ритму. 
Мистер Т, ты говоришь, что я готова к проверке, 
Покажи, как ты производишь первое впечатление. 

О, о, 
Можем ли мы насладиться этим не спеша, не спеша, 
Расставить точки и забыть обо всем? 
Ведь я просто хочу зажигать всю ночь 
В свете неоновых огней так, 
Чтобы ты не смог отпустить меня... 

Я лишь хочу чувствовать твое тело рядом, 
Всю ночь напролет... 
Милый, замедли ритм этой песни. 
А когда приблизится конец, нажми на перемотку, 
Всю ночь напролет... 
Милый, замедли ритм этой песни. 

Если ты хочешь меня, я принимаю предложения 
До тех пор, пока крутится эта пластинка. 
Ты знаешь, я прекрасно декламирую рот в рот... 
Вдохни меня, выдохни меня — 
Это потрясающе! 

О, о, 
Можем ли мы насладиться этим не спеша, не спеша, 
Расставить точки и забыть обо всем? 
Ведь я просто хочу зажигать всю ночь 
В свете неоновых огней так, 
Чтобы ты не смог отпустить меня... 

Я лишь хочу чувствовать твое тело рядом, 
Всю ночь напролет... 
Милый, замедли ритм этой песни. 
А когда приблизится конец, нажми на перемотку, 
Всю ночь напролет... 
Милый, замедли ритм этой песни. 

Вдохни меня, выдохни меня, 
Музыка заставляет меня двигаться. 
Вдохни меня, выдохни меня, 
Не остановимся до самого утра. 
Вдохни меня, выдохни меня, 
Ты знаешь, что я к этому готова, 
К этому, к этому, 
Да... 

Вдохни меня, выдохни меня, 
Музыка заставляет меня двигаться. 
Вдохни меня, выдохни меня, 
Не остановимся до самого утра. 
Вдохни меня, выдохни меня, 
Ты знаешь, что я к этому готова, 
К этому, к этому, 
Да... 

Я лишь хочу чувствовать твое тело рядом, 
Всю ночь напролет... 
Милый, замедли ритм этой песни. 
А когда приблизится конец, нажми на перемотку, 
Всю ночь напролет... 
Милый, замедли ритм этой песни.


(What the heart wants...)
(The heart wants...)
(What the heart wants...)

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby...


Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Trust in me, trust in me

Trust in me


Been a long day, waiting for the night to come
I check my Iphone,
Let me see what's going on, going on, going on
Help me DJ, and play my favorite song,
Make the speakers shake, speakers shake
Now everybody wants to sing along, sing along,
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is
Having a good time when the moon appears
You can always hear us say

[Chorus]
The party doesn't start til the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving,
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ahh, ahh, ahh
The music isn't on till it's way too loud,
That's when everybody starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Pushing my hands up,
I'm feeling good now
On the dance floor,
We can turn it inside out, inside out
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is
Having good time with my friends
That's real, you can always hear us say

[Chorus]

Down,down,down
The sun is going down, down,down
When the moon appears, you can always hear us say
When the stars come out, you can always here us say

[Chorus]


I looked in my rearview mirror, (ahhh) and it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah...
I'm ready to make that turn, before we both crash and burn,
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us...

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies? Guess they didn't count at that stop sign,
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light...
Hey, right when I think that we found it, well, that's when we start turnin' around;
You're saying "Baby, don't worry," but we're still going the wrong way...

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love;
Well, they must've been talking about us,
And sometimes, I feel like we've been here before...
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right...
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight;
Honey, I know we can find our way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, my baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

I feel like my heart is stuck in....
Traffic - I'm under...
Pressure... pressure...
Let's just go back to the way it was...

When we were on (Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, 
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue...)
(Avenue...) Let's just go back...


Baby I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don’t know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words cant even touch what’s in my heart

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane

The words don’t ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can’t explain what I’m feeling

So I say baby baby, baby
Baby I (ooh baby, oh baby, my baby)
Baby I (ooh baby, baby I)
All I’m tryna say is you’re my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it

(Baby, baby oh oh oh oh)

Baby I’m so down for you no matter what you do
(Real talk) I’ll be around
See baby I been feelin’ you
Before I knew what feelings were about

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words don’t ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can’t explain what I’m feeling

And I say baby baby, baby
Baby I (ooh baby, baby I)
All I’m tryna say is you’re my everything baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it

(Baby, baby oh oh oh oh)

Staright up you got me (all in)
How could I not be I sure hope you know
If it’s even possible
I love you more
Than word Love can say it
It’s better not explaining that why I keep saying…

Baby I


(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
Then put your hands up... (Then put your hands up...)
(If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
Then put your hands up... (Then put your hands up...)

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

Sean Don!
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title;
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walk out looking like a model...
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo,
On the moon - who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you... (got you...)
I got you...

Boy, you make me feel so lucky;
Finally the stars align...
Never has it been so easy
To be in love, and to give you this heart of mine...

You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be alright...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh...

And I'll never let you go...

You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

I get butterflies just thinking
About you - boy, you're on my mind...
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming,
Lost in your eyes, and I lose all track of time...

You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be alright...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you, oh...

And I'll never let you go...

You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

(What, okay, what...)
Now if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to public transportation?
Would you still be at home for me, with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too - you know I had some girls missionary;
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary,
And bible, I got it recycled - I love and I like you.
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru,
That's why I got you...

And I'll never let you go... (I got you.)

You should know I'm never gonna change; (I'm never gonna change...)
I'm always gonna stay... (I'm always gonna stay...)
When you call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there...), right there...
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...

(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it! I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)

You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
Got it, babe...


(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
You don't need a lot of money, and you don't have to play no games;
All I need is all your lovin' to get the blood rushing through my veins...

I wanna say we're going steady like it's 1954;
Now, it doesn't have to be forever,
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Ooh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Whoa-oh-oh, yeah...

You don't need to worry about makin' me crazy, 'cause I'm way past that;
So just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me, and I'll show you
How much I wanna be on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby, and lay me in your bed,
And kiss me underneath the moonlight;
Darlin', let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart...

(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh, babe...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...


Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?

Hold up, wait - before you go, just stay,
And talk to me for a little, baby, won't you loosen up just a little?
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...

Hold up, wait - shut up and kiss me, babe;
I just wanna get a little taste, I just wanna get a little taste before you go...
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;

(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)

Time and my trust - don't mess this up!
(You got me falling in love, you got me falling in love, you got me falling so hard...)
Boy, you change the way I breathe when you put your lips on me - I adore you,
So let me make it clear to you that, boy, you're all I need...
Oh, baby...

(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time... (Baby!)
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)

Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?


I could write a song with my new piano;
I could sing about how love is a losing battle...
Not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
It's not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)

And I could sing about Cupid and a shooting arrow;
In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's so hard... (It's so hard...)
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance - don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand...

So hold up and take it through the night,
And you should follow through to make it alright...
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano...

You walked in, caught my attention;
I've never seen a man with so much dimension...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...

Now I can't wait to hold you in my arms;
I know I was made for you - I'm in love with all your charm...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...

Well, I want you - got to have it,
And I need you like I never have loved before...
Oh, I want you - ooh, I need you;
Got to have you like I never had lovin' before...

So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...

Say... I’m thinking 'bout her every second, every hour,
Do my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,
"Do she love me, do she love me not?" (Love me not...)
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot... 

<u>'''Ariana:'''</u>
You give me that kind of something,

Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you,
And I ain’t going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper

Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you’re sleeping in mine,
Come and watch a movie with me - “American Beauty” 
Or “Bruce Almighty” that's groovy, just come and move closer to me...
I got some feelings for you I’m not gonna get bored of,
But baby, you an adventure, so let me come and explore you...

Now you finally tell me how you feel;
Guess your words just came a little too late...
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill;
Don’t be mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced - know your place!

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
Then maybe it’d be different - if you spoke, I would’ve listened, but now I'm with somebody else...
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
And it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

Now it’s probably hard for you to hear,
But there’s nothing left for you to say...
Had my heart all in your hands - boy, what you don’t understand
Is a girl like me don’t have no time to waste around...

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,

(You’ll never know...) Boy, you should’ve let me know...
(You’ll never know...) Boy, you could’ve been there for me,
But now, you’ll never know, you’ll never know...

It’s not my fault you’re a little bit too late;
You’re the only one to blame - Wipe that look off your face...
You can wish a thousand times, but none of that will change my mind, boy;
You had a chance you’ll never get back, get back...

You will never know what we could have been;
If you would’ve shown me way back then...
Boy, you gotta (yep, yep), boy, you shoulda (yep, yep), but you didn't (move, so,)
Now you’ll never know... oh, baby!

I told you once, get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright
But some things are better left unsaid

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,
Like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some face,
Don't blame me just kiss me

(If you wanna party, put your hands up)
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Don't blame me just kiss me
Oh, tonight don't say a thing,
Don't play me just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons,
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
I miss you more every day
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things,

Dear Santa
It's me Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need
Your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I really love him
And it's been kinda tough cause
He's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away
Away from me

I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you

Just make it snow in california
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

Dear Santa
What happened to the plan we had
I checked the news and it said
It'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I I really need him to stay
For a couple more days
Can't you make his
Five o'clock flight delay
Won't you find a way

I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you

Just make it snow in california
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

I know I'm asking for the impossible
But I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me
So please, please

Just make it snow in california
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a


Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
I been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Oh yeah

Santa honey, the one thing that I really do need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring, but I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

So hurry down the chimney tonight (waiting)
Hurry tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

Oh, I promise you...

Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you;

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it,
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it...
Can't you forgive me at least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful...

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore (ooh)

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever (yeah, babe)
On the highway to hell, yeah (ooh)

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby
(Oooh)

Thought on your body I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh baby!

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more


'''Ariana Grande:'''
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left,
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
Why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time,
Can we please make up our minds,
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

'''Big Sean:'''
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we Ziploc it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
I guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
Hold up - I know love could be a beach with no shore,
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need,
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue,
You ask why I love your mom so much? 'Cause she's a older you.
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest.
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had.

'''Ariana:'''
Break up, make up, total waste of time;
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made,
But we hold on, hmm, hold on.
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
But we hold on, hmm, hold on, yeah.

'''(Sean:)'''
You're, you're, you're, you're,
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

You're, you're, you're, you're,
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you.
(Be-be-be-best mistake you ever had)

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him..
To think that I was wrong;
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone...
Pain is just a consequence of love;
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us...

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling,
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure...
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...

'Cause you weren't my everything til we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...

You are, you are, you are...
You are, you are, you are... my everything...



(I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you)
(Let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself, let me introduce myself)

Lookin' in your eyes
Makes me wonder how
I got so much time
With you and there's more around
I know all the competition after to you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

That we're living
In a fairytale, no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside you is only mine

That's how I know
I can't be your only one 
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't
I can't be your only one
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget it, yeah

As I'm laying down, with you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairytale, no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one 
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't
I can't be your only one
No I, can't be your only one
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget
No I can't

(Only one)
(Be your only one)
(Only one)


(Whoa, whoa)
(H-h-here we go)

Center of attention once again
They don’t understand
They don’t understand, no

Then they try to tell me who I am
They don’t understand
They don’t understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can’t be looking for me then
I don't even need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told

I see you thinking 
But there's just one thing de-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand, no

Thinking you're the reason that it ends
But you won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can’t be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs
Is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me 'cause that's not reality
And so I can't be a silhouette of who I'm becoming
You don't know me but there's more to see, my love

You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Untill you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
(You don't know me)
I don't need to live by your rules
(You don't control me)
Until you walked a mile in my shoes
(You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
And you don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
But there's just one thing d-e-e-e-e-e-ear
You think you know but you don't have no idea-a-a-a-a-a
Think you know me but there's more to see, my love
(My love)


Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...

Summer days with my honey, worried 'bout not a thing,
Back in the day when things were easier than the breeze...
Who knew that kiss was the last one? I never thought we would change;
Baby, I'm missing you...

Oh, we shoulda been forever, but we fell apart;
Might have separated, but you took my heart...
Always knew I wasn't really over us,
And sometimes, I catch myself...

Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...
You! Yeah... 
Oh...

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing cause time was all we spent...

Oh, we shoulda been forever, but we fell apart;
Might have separated, but you took my heart...
Always knew I wasn't really over us,
And sometimes, I catch myself...

Ridin' round in my Cadillac, thinkin' 'bout the day that I first saw you;
Nothin' compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change...
I want you, babe... I still want you, baby...
I still want you...
You! Yeah...
Oh, babe... mm...
Oh, baby... oh, babe...


You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy you got my mind
Playing truth or dare
It's daring me to kiss you right there

Though we've been friends so long
And it seem so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show

I've thinking about you
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby tell me
Do you feel it like I do
Cause we both know what could go
Down if we get too close

Ahhhhh
But if we get too close
Ahhhhh
Down if we get to close

Remember that girl that you used to date
She's with my ex-boyfriend
That's great
So what would you do
What would you say if I said I loved you that way

Though we've been friends so long
That it seem so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show

I've thinking about you
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby tell me
Do you feel it like I do
Cause we both know what could go
Down if we get too close

Ahhhhh
But if we get too close
Ahhhhh
Down if we get to close

But I just can't let it show

I've thinking about you
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby tell me
Do you feel like I do
Cause we both know what could go
Down if we get too close

Ahhhh
But if we get to close
Ahhhh
Down if we get too close
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh

You've got me feeling emotions
And higher, higher, higher

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

Feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Now in the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

Feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Oh, you emotions
Oh, deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Baby, you've got me feelin' emotions
Higher than the heavens above, oh yeah yeah

Now you know the way 
To make me lose control
When you're lookin' into my eyes
You make me feel so

Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feelin' emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you emotions

High emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you, emotions, emotions
You got me feelin' higher

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live 
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give 
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss 
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open? 

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash 
You tossed it in the trash, you did 
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
'Cause what you don't understand is 

I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya 

I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes, I would die for you, baby 
But you won't do the same 
No, no, no, no 

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb 
Tell the devil I said hey, when you get back to where you're from 
Mad boy, bad boy, that's just what you are, yeah 
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car 

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash 
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did 
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 
'Cause what you don't understand is 

I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya 

I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes, I would die for ya, baby 
But you won't do the same 

If my body was on fire 
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames 
You said you loved me, you're a liar 
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby 

But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya 
I would go through all this pain 
Take a bullet straight through my brain 
Yes, I would die for you, baby 
But you won't do the same 
No, you won't do the same 
You wouldn't do the same 
Ooh, you never do the same 
No, no, no, no


Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away, oh ooh
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore, ah
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more, ooh
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Oooh...
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more, oh
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow, oh yeah
But 'til then we'll have to muddle through, somehow
Oh yeah, oh ooh oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now


Where are we? What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling
Spin me round again and rub my eyes
This can't be happening

When busy streets a mess with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
Hide and seek
All those years they were here first
Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did

Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Because it is

Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's just what we need?
And you decided this

What'd you say?
Mmm, what did she say?

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit

You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit


Been runnin' round in circles
Tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy
While chillin' with my friends

He's eyein' me
Sizin' me
Makes my body weak
He's bringin' out the freak in me

It's only been a minute
Since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you
I feel this
Spark ignite

[Chorus: x2]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doin'
Livin' let it go (go, go)
Ridin' havn' good times and
No one has to know

He's eyein' me 
Sizin' me
Makes my body weak
He's bringin' out the freak in me

It's only been a minute
Since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you
I feel this
Spark ignite

[Chorus: x2]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

We got that jam
Make them dance 
Make them lose their minds
(Ooohhh ummmm hmhm)

We got that jam
Make them dance 
Make them lose their minds
(Oh yeah)

We got that jam 
Make them dance 
Make them lose their minds
(Uh huh)

We got that jam
Make them dance
Make them lose their minds
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus x4]



Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, with what I can hold onto

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me, no
Don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh, ooh, ooh


Just for now
Just for now
Just for now
Just for now
Just for now
Just for now

How did you know?
It's what I always wanted
Could never have had too many of these
Would you, quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying; will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

It's that time of year
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Bite tongue
Deep breaths
Count to ten
Nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music?
Better quick sharp remove it
Pour me another
Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
(x4)

Get me out of here
Just for love
Just for love



On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised

Even Angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhhh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right

Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhhh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, But I don't wanna ever leave
Till' these walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhhh, I love the way you lie



'''Graham:'''
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

Ariana:
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle I stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from the Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

Fall on my knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

'''Both:'''
Fall on your knees // Fall on my knees
Both:
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night

They’ll hear us in LA
We’re poppin’ like pink champagne x 3

Don’t need no guest list
Everybody’s invited
I said even if you can’t get in
We’ll dance outside it
We’re gonna make this bubble
Carbonate some trouble
When your life gets back
Gotta take it back to another level

Lemme hear you say
Ooooh
Can you keep it bottled up?
X 2

Make it pop like pink champagne
In the purple rain
Gonna paint paint paint the city
Gonna show off all our pretty, pretty

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I tried to call my mother, but
She didn't get where I was going
I called my boyfriend and he said
Call me back a little later baby
I hung up the phone, I felt so alone
Started to feel a little pity
That's when I realized that I
Gotta find the joy inside of me

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I wanna take off all my clothes
Look at myself in the mirror
We're gonna have a conversation
We're gonna heal the disconnection
I don't remember when it started
But this is where it's gonna end
My body is beautiful and sacred
And I'm gonna celebrate it

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

All my life 
I've been looking for 
Somebody else 
To make me whole
But I had to learn the hard way 
True love began with me
This is not ego or vanity
I'm just celebrating me

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
Baby look how far we've come here
I'm havin' a private party
I'm learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

[Graham]
There you come with your big, brown eyes and I'm so sure you got me mesmerized. 
So sure I'm just about to fall for you
But you don't even try and catch me, so I.

[Ariana]
I pick myself up, I pick myself up.
Boy, you might be falling but I think I better not.
I'm gonna take my time, but 

[Both]
don't leave cause there's something about me and you.

You gotta stick around, stick around around. 
Oh, You gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found.
You gotta stick around.

[Graham]
Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me.
I've always been the kind to think things out.
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about.
So I.

[Ariana]
I make my mind up, I make my mind up.
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush.
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so.
Wait a minute

[Both]
Till I got you all figured out.

You gotta stick around, stick around, around.
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if its
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found.
You gotta stick around.

Take a look, take a breath.
Take a chance on everything I've said.
Take your heart. And take your time.
And maybe one day you'll be mine.
Ohh, maybe one day you'll be mine. [Woah].
Yeah!

You gotta stick around, sick around, round.
Oh, you gotta hang round' if you wanna find out if its.
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found.
Stick around, stick around, round.
Oh, you gotta hand 'round if you wanna find out if its.
Love, baby, real love, love baby we've found.
You gotta stick around.

There you come with your big brown eyes and I'm
So sure you've got me mesmerized.
Sick around.


Frankie:
Lift up your head
Wash off your mascara
Here take my Kleenex
Wipe that lipstick away
Just kidding
Show me your face clean as the morning
I know things were bad
But now they're okay

Suddenly Frankie is standing beside you
You don't need no make-up
Don't have to pretend
Suddenly Frankie is here to provide you
Sweet understanding

Ariana:
Nobody ever treated me kindly
Daddy left early
Mama was poor
I'd meet a man
And I'd follow him blindly
He'd snap his fingers
Me, I'd say, "Sure"

Suddenly Frankie is standing beside me
He don't give me orders
He don't condescend
Suddenly Frankie is here to provide me
Sweet understanding
Frankie's my friend

Frankie:
Tell me this feeling
Will last 'til forever
Tell me the bad times are clean washed away
Ariana:
Please understand that it's still strange and frightening
For losers like I've been it's so hard to say

Ariana (Frankie):
Suddenly Frankie
(Suddenly Frankie)
He purified me

Her voice is echoed in my mind 
I count the days till she is mine 
Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh 
I love a girl from senior class 

I daydream my way through freshman math 
While she fills our her college apps 
I'll show her a world where we belong 
But she'll have to drive us to the prom 

(Chorus)
That's what I go to school for 
Even though it is a real bore 
You can call me crazy 
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for 
Even though it is a real bore 
Girlfriends I've had plenty 
But she's the one that I need 
That's what I go to school for 
That's what I go to school for 

Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen 
But that doesn't bother me 
He's back at college out of town 
I find a reason to go round 

I climb a tree outside her home 
To make sure she is alone 
She looks up and sees me there 
Still I cant help but stop and stare 

(Chorus)
That's what I go to school for 
Even though it is a real bore 
You can call me crazy 
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for 
Even though it is a real bore 
Girlfriends I've had plenty 
But she's the one that I need 
That's what I go to school for 
That's what I go to school for 



(Bridge)
Everyone that you see all day knows you're looking at me in a different way 
I guess that's why my marks are getting so high 
I can see those tell tale signs telling me that I was on your mind 
I could see that you want it more when you told me that I'm what you go to school for 
I'm what you go to school for 

She's made her choice and I'm the one 
At least 'til graduation comes 
We drive past school to wave goodbye 
My friends they can't believe their eyes 

That's what I go to school for 
Even though it is a real bore 
You can call me crazy 
I know that she loves me 
That's what I go to school for 
Even though it is a real bore 
Girlfriends I've had plenty 
But she's the one that I need 
That's what I go to school for 
That's what I go to school for



[Verse 1]
I've been wasting my time 
I've been losing my mind 
I've been running races 
Still don't know what I've been chasing 
But my eyes still can see 
Bluer skies that wait for me 
And I'm on my way 

[Chorus]
Time for me to fly 
Time for me to soar 
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heavens door
Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly 

[Verse 2]
The earth can be a heavy ride 
When the clouds are in your eyes 
But I feel a calling 
I will rise, I won't be falling 
And I'll escape the gravity 
And I'll reach my destiny 
And I'll fly away 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
The gates of heaven will open wide 
I will be 
I will rise 
There won't be compromise 
As I take to the open skies 

I will fly away 
I will fly away 
I will fly away


One day when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He said that he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah
He said

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one and another one
And another one!
And girls there with round hair, like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah, whoo!
He said

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold [[Kelly Clarkson]]
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum.
Everybody bought our seventh album, seventh album

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah yeah

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)



Wednesday I came home from school 
Did my homework in my room 
then I watched some TV 
I still miss you 
Thursday morning went online 
Got to school at half past nine 
Wound up in detention 
I still miss you 

Everything I do (oh) 
it brings me back to you 

And I die 
One day at a time 
'Cause I just cant seem to get you off my mind 
No matter how I try 
try to kill the time 
well I think that im just going crazy 
one day at a time 

Friday I got out of bed 
Tried to smile frowned instead 
Burnt some toast for breakfast 
I still miss you 
Saturday I turned 16 
Never dreamt you'd act so mean 
You didn't even call me 
But I still miss you 

And When I turn 94 
I think ill miss u even more 

And I die 
One day at a time 
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind 
No matter how I try 
try to kill the time 
well I think that im just going crazy 
one day at a time 

I miss you more than I did a minute ago 
I Climb a mountain just to here your echo (hoo, hoo) 
All I wanted was you 
Tell me please do u think of me now and then 
Cause if I never see you again 
I'd still miss you 

And I die 
One day at a time 
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind 
No matter how I try 
try to kill the time 
well I think that im just going craaazy 
one day at a time 

(Oooo) one day at a time 
Well I think that im just going crazy one day at a time 
Oo I think im going crazy ooooooo 
One day at a time


She's the kinda girl that you see in the movies 
Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me 
Down by the shore first weekend of the summer 
Gotta take chance and just ask for her number 
I wish I had a song on MTV 
Cause in a crowded room I'd be the only one she sees
She's looking bored and now I'm running out of time 
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine 

One minute and the earth begins to shake 
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break 
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new 
That's just three minutes with you 
Four minutes and she's everything I see 
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be 
Another minute everything feels so new  
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes.

She's looking at her watch while the dj is spinning 
This could be the end or its just the beginning 
She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better 
Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never 
I wish that I was on the radio 
I'd sing her favorite song she'd be front row at every show 
This parties lame and now I'm running out of time 
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine 

One minute and the earth begins to shake 
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break 
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new 
That's just three minutes with you 
Four minutes and she's everything I see 
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be 
Another minute everything feels so new 
I need six minutes with you 
Six minutes 

Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye 
Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye 
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy (that guy, that guy, that guy) 

Yeah...time is passing by 
I'm losing my mind 
I need 
1...2...3...4...5...6 minutes with you 

One minute and the earth begins to shake 
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break 
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new 
That's just three minutes with you 
Four minutes and she's everything I see 
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be 
Another minute everything feels so new 
I need six minutes with you 
Six minutes


Mandy used to be that girl 
The one that never said a word 
But she always sang 
S Club 7 and all those boy bands 
Now it's been a few years 
It looks like things have changed 
Now she's mine and I want to say 

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid 
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance 
With her it's never wasted time 
Mandy always knows exactly what I'm 
Thinking and she's always on my mind 
And now, I'm never gonna let her go 
Cause Mandy always knows 

Mandy always tells the truth 
Even when it's hard to do 
And she always understands 
Even when it don't make sense 
Even though she is a blonde 
I'm the one that feels so dumb 

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid 
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance 
With her it's never wasted time 
Mandy always knows exactly what I'm 
Thinking and she's always on my mind 
And now, I'm never gonna let her go 
Cause Mandy always knows 

When I have a problem 
I'm sure that Mandy knows 
When I'm feeling lonely 
I'm sure that Mandy knows 
When everything's crazy 
She's always there for me 
And I'm sure that she knows 
I'm never ever gonna let her go

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid 
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance 
With her it's never wasted time 
Mandy always knows exactly what I'm 
Thinking and she's always on my mind 
And now, I'm never gonna let her go 
Cause Mandy always knows 



(1st Verse)
You just don't know it It's getting hard to say hello You just don't know it I'm on the edge of crossing
the line I don't want to blow it, or show it Before you know you're mine You just don't know it 

(Chorus)
Oh, you won't see me break Won't make that mistake Oh no I'll just walk away There too much at stake
right now I go on and on Singing this song about you And that's what's wrong with this song 

(2nd Verse)
Can you feel it? In the way I look at you Girl, can you hear it? I'm crying out inside I don't want to
see you Be near you You're a million miles too close 

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge)
You don't know the way I feel So I'll stay alone 

(Repeat Chorus)



I am what I am 
I can't help myself 
And if you don't like it 
Get with somebody else 
I'll never change my ways 
It's not a phase 
This is how it is and this is how it's gonna stay 
Because 
I am what I am I know what I'm not 
I'm not the type of guy 
That doesn't know how good he's got it 
And I won't back down 
Won't come around 
Saying that I changed cause 
That's not how it's going down 

And I know (I know, I know) 
Wherever I go (I go, I go) 
I know where I stand 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 

I am what I am 
What can I say? 
I'm gonna be this way 
Right up until my dying day 
Because that's how it goes head to my toes 
And if it doesn't show well I just had to let you know 
Because 

I am what I am 
And nobody else 
And if you've got a problem 
Better take it somewhere else 
Because I can't turn back 
I'm right on track 
And if you think you know 
Well then you better check your facts 
Because 

I know (I know, I know) 
Wherever I go (I go, I go) 
I know where I stand 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 

Oh can't you see 
I'm just being me 
I can't be you 
And I don't want to be 
Don't try to get 
Inside my head 
Cause what you see is what you get 

I am what I am 
I can't help myself 
And if you don't like it 
Get with somebody else 
I'll never change my ways 
It's not a phase 
This is how it is right up until my dying day 

And I know (I know, I know) 
Wherever I go (I go, I go) 
I know where I stand 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 
I am what I am 
Hey! Hey! 
I am what I am 



(1st Verse)
She's an underdog 
Lives next door to me 
She's always heard you won't amount to anything 
And it kills me to watch the agony beyond her eyes 
Tragic the way people pass her by 
But now I realize 

(Chorus)
That everyone sees her 
But nobody knows her 
She screams in her pillow 
For a better tomorrow 
She hates it 
But she takes it 
Watch out for that girl 
One day she may change the world 

(2nd Verse)
She's original 
Never trying to fit in 
She's got a way to always go 
Against the grain 
Oh yea! 
Someday they'll see how beautiful she really is 
I know that last will be the first 
The tables gonna turn cause... 

(Chorus)
That everyone sees her 
But nobody knows her 
She screams in her pillow 
For a better tomorrow 
She hates it 
But she fakes it 
Watch out for that girl 
One day she may change the world 

(Bridge)
Maybe she'll be in a movie 
Maybe she'll be in a song 
Better pay her some attention 
Before she's gone 

(Additional Lyrics)
She's an underdog 
Yea 
She means the world to me 
Yea 

(Chorus)
Everyone sees her 
But nobody knows her 
She screams in her pillow 
For a better tomorrow 
She hates it 
But she makes it 
Watch out for that girl 
One day she may change the world 

(Chorus)
Everyone sees her 
But nobody knows her 
She screams in her pillow 
For a better tomorrow 
She hates it 
But she makes it 
Watch out for that girl 
One day she may change the world



We had a lot of good times when we were together 
And I thought we'd last forever, you and I 
Eyeing for so long I couldn't wait to get you're phone call 
Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright 
Tonight you called me on the phone 
Said you had to stay at home 
Is there something I should know?

Till she walked out the door and right out of my life 
If you're gone ill move on 
But it only would have taken two seconds to say 
Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (woahwoo) 

The night after you're phone call me and friends were hanging at the mall 
I was not believing what I saw 
(Whoa) holding hands with him and sitting closer then six inches 
Hoping she's not gunna kiss him now 

How can I call you a friend, you stood me up in the end 
I know that it's over 

I was fine till 7:05 
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life 
If you're gone I'll move on 
But it only would of taken two seconds to say 
Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (woahwoo) 

Don't keep telling me that yore sorry now 
But let me tell you how much this hurts me too 
(Yeah ooo)

Till she walked out the door and right out of my life 
If you're gone ill move on 
But it only would have taken two seconds to say 
Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye (woahwoo)

They come and go but they don't know
That you are my beautiful
I try to come closer with you
But they all say we won't make it through

But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
Our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you 'til the end
The end of time
Please be mine
Ohhhhh...oooooooo...

I'm in and out of love with you
Trying to find if it's really true
Oh no no no no
How can I prove my love
If they all think I'm not good enough

But I'll be there forever 
You will see that it's better
Our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you 'til the end
The end of time
Please be mine
Ohhhhh...oooooooo...yea...ohhhhh...oooooooo...yea...

Can't stop my heart from calling you

Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well I'm done
With awkward situations and empty
Conversations

Oooh
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass 
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

So this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M.
Well I'm done 
With texting
Sorry for the miscommunication

Oooh 
This is a S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess 
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
Cause hugs are over-rated just F.Y.I.

Oooh 
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess 
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
Yeah

Oooh
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get




We don't have time left to regret
Hold on
It will take more than common sense
Hold on
So stop your wonderin', take a stand

When you love someone and they break your heart
Don't give up on love

All your hope is gone
Don't forget to
Hold on
Hold on

Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don't give up on love

Just hold on
Hold on

Just hold on
Hold on

This has been no walk in the park
I feel like we have fallen apart
Open up your eyes girl and see
How wonderful this love could be

Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on
So say goodbye 'cause
I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye

Lala la la la lalalala

You say you didn't mean to break
My heart but girl you did, I'm over it
Adieu to you and all your games
And all your crazy friends
This is the end

Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on
So say goodbye
'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye

Lala la la la lalalala

Well girl, I'm sorry for disappointing you
But I'm done
With being up and down and pushed around
No more

Hold on tight
It's a roller coaster ride we're on
So say goodbye
'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye

Hold on tight
it's a roller coaster ride we're on
Say goodbye
'Cause I won't be back again
Up and down
You're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye




I woke up on the roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be if we couldn't dream

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll

You've got moves
I've got shoes
Let's go dancing
Pop and lock
Battle dance
Against Hanson
If we lose
All the girls
They'll be laughing
Where would we be if we couldn't dream

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll

Cause we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
Cause that's just the way we roll

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll
That's just the way we roll
Oh, that's just the way we roll




Hello beautiful
How's it going
I hear it's wonderful
In California
I've been missing you
It's true

But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah tonight, I'm gonna fly
Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes

Hello beautiful
It's been a long time
Since my phone's rung
And you've been on that line
I've been missing you
It's true

But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah tonight, I'm gonna fly, oh yeah
Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes




She was all I ever wanted
She was all I ever needed and more
Then she walked out my door
And she went away
Left my heart in two 
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, woo

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you

We had fun under the sun
And when winter came, she'd be my angel
We were so in love
Then she went away
Left my heart in two 
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, yeah

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you

I don't know what hurts worse baby
Seeing you with him 
Or being alone
On my own
I know he doesn't love you baby
Not like I did
Oh what's the point
You're not listening anyway

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
Won't regret it
Cause I'm still in love with you




You never listen to me, I know I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true, yeah, we all see through you
No, it won't be hard to do
To go and waste myself on you, ooh

And I'll wait for her, to come
And she won't break my heart
Because I know
She'll be from Australia

She is so, beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl

You were the one I thought I needed, I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true, they know all your secrets
The only thing you knew was true has just walked out of your life
How does it feel?

So I'll wait for her, to come
And she won't break my heart
Because I know
She'll be from Australia

She is so, beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl

And she will be there, it's not that you care
And no, there's no need to worry, the girl of my dreams
Who I know will be there to hold me when I'm down
'Till she's around

I'll just wait for her, to come
And she won't break my heart
Because I know
She'll be from Australia

She is so, beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl, oh, yeah

So I'll wait for her, to come
And she won't break my heart
Because I know, she'll be 
From Australia

She is so, beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl, dream girl




I'm waiting for you right outside
The place we first locked eyes
(Oh)

I feel like we're both losing sides
We don't get to do this twice
And I wonder...

Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's time
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
I'm so bored with these games, (games), games, (games)

The last time that I left these steps
Was after our first kiss
I wonder why you haven't shown
I'll be leaving here alone
And I wonder

Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's time
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
I'm so bored with these games, (games), games (games)

Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
And I'm so bored with these games

I'm left in the dark 
I never thought you'd be breaking my heart
I'm so bored with these games, (games), games (games)

Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's time
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
I'm soo bored with these games, (games),  games, (games)

Games, (oh games), games, oh yeah (games)



If the heart is always searching, 
Can you ever find a home? 
I've been looking for that someone, 
I'll never make it on my own. 
Dreams can't take the place of loving you, 
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes, 
And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When you look me in the eyes, 
I catch a glimpse of heaven. 
I find my paradise, 
When you look me in the eyes. 

How long will I be waiting, 
To be with you again 
Gonna tell you that I love you, 
In the best way that I can. 
I can't take a day without you here, 
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear. 

When you look me in the eyes, 
And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When you look me in the eyes, 
I catch a glimpse of heaven. 
I find my paradise, 
When you look me in the eyes. 

More and more, I start to realize, 
I can reach my tomorrow, 
I can hold my head up high, 
And it's all because you're by my side. 

When you look me in the eyes, 
And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go 

Cause when you look me in the eyes. 

And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When you look me in the eyes, 
I catch a glimpse of heaven. 
I find my paradise, 
When you look me in the eyes. 



Take my hand tonight
We can run so far
We can change the world, 
Do anything you want
We can stop for hours 
Just staring at the stars
They shine down to show us

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
And we'll be running so fast we can fly, tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart 
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know... we're inseparable 

We could run forever if you wanted to
I would not get tired
Because I'd be with you
I'd keep singing this song
Until the very end
We'd have done all these things

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be runnin' so fast we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You'll still be holdin' all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know... we're inseparable

I will give it all
Never let you fall
But you know we're inseparable
I would give it all
Just to show you I'm in love
Cause you know
We're inseparable

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be runnin' so fast we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You'll still be holdin' all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know... we're inseparable




There she goes again, the girl I'm in love with
It's cool, we're just friends, we walk the halls at school
We know it casual, it's cool, we're just

I don't want to lead you on
No, but the truth is I've grown fond, yeah

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
Till the end of time, till I'm on her mind, it'll happen

I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I just keep on dreaming

But it's cool 'cause we're just friends

Small talk on IM, just one word sentences
It's cool, we're just friends
If I had my way, we'd talk and talk all day, yeah

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
Till the end of time, till I'm on her mind, it'll happen

I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I just keep on dreaming

But it's cool 'cause we're just friends

Thinking about how, we're gonna say our vows
It's cool we're just friends, he walks down the aisle
Seeing my face smile 'cause now, we're more than friends

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
Till the end of time, till I'm on your mind, it'll happen

We've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I just keep on dreaming

Just keep on thinking about when we used to be just friends

(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la)
When we used to be, when we used to be

(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la)
Just friends
(La, la, la, la, la)
When we used to be just friends







As time was ticking
We were winning
And it all was going as planned
Politicians stand between the lines
Of making headlines, street signs
Saying you're going the wrong way, fading faster now

You can try to break us and make us fall apart
But the fire's in our hearts
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone

And don't forget to hold back your thoughts
And live like robots cuz we all know what goes on
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone, we're gone, so gone

Fallen soldiers, all around us
But we're still standing strong
Embarrassing and contradicting
Cuz now we're making headlines, prime time
Saying, what a story, billboards, packed tours, don't forget

You can try to break us and make us fall apart
But the fire's in our hearts
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone

And don't forget to hold back your thoughts
And live like robots cuz we all know what goes on
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone, we're gone, so gone

And game over, you're done, ooh
Out of left field, we won
And pack our bags, yeah, we'll run
Hollywood, here we come

You can try to break us and make us fall apart
But the fire's in our hearts
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone

And don't forget to hold back your thoughts
And live like robots cuz we all know what goes on
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone, we're gone, so gone


You can try to break us and make us fall apart
But the fire's in our hearts
Reminisce on the memories cuz we're gone




One day when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He said that he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah
He said

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one and another one
And another one!
And girls there with round hair, like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah, whoo!
He said

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold [[Kelly Clarkson]]
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum.
Everybody bought our seventh album, seventh album

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah yeah

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine (Is doing fine)

Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter

We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids of the future

Standing on a dirty old rooftop
Down below, the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why

Come on, Lewis, keep moving foward
Hold your head up high
There's no time for looking down
You will not believe where we're going now

Here we go, let me remind you
Look ahead, the past is behind you

We're the kids of the future (whoa oh)
We're the kids of the future (whoa oh)
Everybody live 'cause the future is now
(Now now now now now now now now...)

Bright lights, boy, look around you
Your imagination is working overtime
The world that you've dreamt of has now arrived

Hot shots
The greatest adventure is where
The family you've searched for comes alive
So come meet the Robinsons

Lookin' for a place you belong to
Lookin' for a family that wants you

We're the kids of the future (whoa oh)
We're the kids of the future (whoa oh)
Everybody live 'cause the future is now
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah sing nah nah nah nah nah nah

Everyday we have fun, me and Wilbur
So happy to be here with the Robinsons
I finally feel I can be someone

Outside, a new day is dawning
Outside, day light is sprawling everywhere
I know that it's right because

We'll save the future together
This family is forever

We're the kids of the future (whoa oh)
We're the kids of the future (whoa oh)
Everybody live, 'cause the future is now
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah sing nah nah nah nah nah nah

We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids, we're the kids of the future


I walked across a crowded street
a sea of eyes cut through me, and I saw you in the middle.
your upset face, you wear it well,
you camouflage the way you feel when every thing's the matter
we've all been down that road before,
searching for that something more.

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you take a breath,
just take a breath.
people change and promises are broken.
clouds can move and skies will be wide open.
don't forget to take a breath.

blink our eyes, life's rearranged.
to our surprise, it's still okay.
it's the way things happen.
summer comes and then it goes.
hold on tight and brace for cold
and its only for a moment
we've all been down that road before,
searching for that something more

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you take a breath,
just take a breath.
people change and promises are broken.
clouds can move and skies will be wide open.
don't forget to take a breath.

life isn't suffocating
air isn't overrated

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you take a breath,
just take a breath. (x2)

people change and promises are broken.
clouds can move and skies will be wide open.
don't forget to take a breath.

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you,
dont forget to take a breath.

(dont forget to take a breath) (fade)

It was cloudy on that night
There were no stars in sight
Then the planets are aligned
When i saw her eyes
One look thats all it took
To send me to another galaxy

She said she was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity
Never let her go
I hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

We were watching Star Wars
She looked kinda bored
Said she'd seen it all before
Made me wonder even more
Which universe was hers
What galaxy did she call home
(Yeah)

She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity
Never let her go
I hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Staring me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'ma trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

The brothers singing loud (and we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (don't try and fight it)
Big Rob is for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor)
It keeps on burnin' up (more and more)
I got JB with me laying it down
Come on boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeah)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (yea, come on, Nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby



he's such a flirt
And I am the lonely heart
Give it a chance
For our love to start
But you'll never see
If you don't give me a shot
To show you what I got

But it's too late
To pretend
You know me better
Than I know myself
Don't take my heart
And put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next girl who will
Make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love
To someone else

I held your hand
It felt like a movie
I made some plans
But you were
Already moving on
Now I'm stuck
Under a rainy cloud
But you
Don't seem to care
But it's alright
Cuz

It's too late
To pretend
You know me better
Than I know myself
Don't take my heart
And put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next girl who will
Make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love
To someone else

I'm tired
Of wasting all my time
My heart
Is hanging on the line
Is it me, boy?
Or someone else? 
Please take me off the shelf

Too late
To pretend
You know me better
Than I know myself
Don't take my heart
And put it on a shelf

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

(Everybody!)

Always someone else
The next girl
Who will make
Your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love
To someone else
Yeah


I feel like I'm
Gonna go insane
Cuz I keep hearing
Your voice call my name
In an empty room girl
You're the one I see
Let me tell you
Girl we're history

I'm a one man show
(One man show)
I don't need no one
(Need no one)
I'll be fine alone
(Fine alone)

Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
Felt so close but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless, over the edge, I'm just
breathless, I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
hopeless, head over heels in the moment,
I never thought that I'd get hit, by this love bug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
[I can't get you out of my mind]
I think about your eyes all the time
you're beautiful but you don't even try
(don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

Now I'm speechless, over the edge I'm just,
breathless, I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
hopeless, head over heels in the moment,
I never thought that I'd get hit by, this love bug again

Kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby cant you see

Now I'm...

Now I'm speechless, over the edge of this,
breathless, i never thought that I'd catch this, love bug again
and now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment,
i never thought that I'd get hit, by this love bug again
[ohhhhh]
Love Bug again
[woo!]



Well here we are again 
Throwing punch-lines, no one wins 
As the morning sun begins to rise 
We're fading fast 
We won't work this out 

No we're not gonna work this out tonight 
No we're not gonna make this right 
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye 
(Give a kiss and say goodbye)
Cuz we're not gonna work this out tonight 

Every single word's been said (whoa oh oh) 
Broke each others hearts again (whoa oh oohh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine 
We're breaking down 
She screams out 


No we're not gonna work this out tonight 
No we're not gonna make this right 
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye 
(Give a kiss and say goodbye)
Cuz we're not gonna work this out tonight 

We don't have to fight tonight 
We just gotta try tonight
We're gonna work this out 
We don't have to fight tonight
We just gotta try 
Tonight

No we're not gonna work this out tonight 
No we're not gonna make this right 
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye 
(Give a kiss and say goodbye)
Cuz we're not going to work this out tonight 

Well there's no need to fight
We're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well we know we're in love
So let's keep it alive (keep it alive, keep it alive)
Tonight
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out

Girl: OMG, did you hear I'm dating a Jonas Brother
It's SOO hot

That didn't work you shoulda known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you find out soon
That the treatment wasn't worth it

They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even bein' funny

Well I've been
Here before
And I've seen
First hand and front row seat
This little thing they call
A video girl (girl, girl)

Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
Cuz I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

You know it's bad when your momma doesn't like her
All your friends are saying she's a liar
Never ending phone calls aren't enough
(it's not enough, it's never enough)
Move to L.A
Got no talent
Not even like you won a miss teen pagant
Daddy pays your bills but you still whine

I've been here before
And I've seen
First hand and front row seat
What happens to a man
(what happens to a man)
When he gets in the hands of a

Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
Cuz I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

You are never gonna see me missin'
(video girl syndrome)
I'm not gonna be another victim of the video girl syndrome

Yeah Oh Whoa Oh

Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
(I won't be a victim)
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

I won't be a victim
Of the video girl syndrome


Run, run like you do
I'm chasin' you,
I'm on your tail
I'm gaining fast, 
You're going nowhere
Try, to fix what you've done
Turn back the sun
The night is calling and
We're falling faster now

Pushin' me away
Every last word
Every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now but
It's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care 
Then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push push 
Pushin' me away

Stop,

I'm getting close so
Take my hand and
Please just tell me why

Pushin' me away
Every last word
Every single thing you say

Broken hearts
And last goodbyes
Restless nights
But lullabyes
Help to make this
Pain go away
I realize I let you down
Told you that I'd be around
I'm buliding up the strength
Just to say

I'm sorry
For breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
It's on me
This time is the last time
I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

Filled with sorrow
Filled with pain
Knowing that I am to blame
For leaving your heart
Out in the rain
And I know your gonna
Walk away
And leave me with
The price to pay
Before you go I
Wanted to say (yeeaah)

That I'm sorry
For breaking all the promises
That I wasn't round to keep
It's on me
This time is the last time
I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

I can't make it
Alive on my own
But if you have to go
Then please girl
Just leave me alone
Cause I don't wanna see
You and me going
Our seperate ways
I'm begging you to stay
If it isn't too late

I'm sorry
For breaking all the promises
That I wasn't round to keep
It's on me
This time is the last time
I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

But you're already on your way

Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

When I thought it'd all been done
when I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so close
And every time you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know (no, no)
You don't even know

All this time goes by
Still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

Waiting on a cure
But none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know (no, no)
You don't even know (no, no)
You don't even know (no, no)

So I'll wait till kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

(Yeah)
(HEY!,  HEY!, HEY!)

I was sittin' at home
Watchin' TV all alone
So tired of re-runs
I memorized this show
So I pick up the phone
Call everyone I know
I say there's gonna be a party
Hit the music 
Here we go
Yeah

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock and roll

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

We were out on the floor
Yeah we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch
And said that it was late

Then she pulled me aside
And said she couldn't stay
But I begged her for
One more song
Let the music play

Yeah

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock and roll

It was cloudy on that night
There were no stars in sight
Then the planets are aligned
When i saw her eyes
One look thats all it took
To send me to another galaxy

She said she was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity
Never let her go
I hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

We were watching Star Wars
She looked kinda bored
Said she'd seen it all before
Made me wonder even more
Which universe was hers
What galaxy did she call home
(Yeah)

She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity
Never let her go
I hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world



I woke up on the roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be if we couldn't dream

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll

You've got moves
I've got shoes
Let's go dancing
Pop and lock
Battle dance
Against Hanson
If we lose
All the girls
They'll be laughing
Where would we be if we couldn't dream

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll

Cause we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
Cause that's just the way we roll

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll

And I know, we get a little crazy
And I know, we get a little loud
And I know, we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks, but
That's just the way we roll
That's just the way we roll
Oh, that's just the way we roll




We don't have time left to regret
Hold on
It will take more than common sense
Hold on
So stop your wonderin', take a stand
Hold on
there's more to life than just to live
Hold on

Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

One single smile, a helping hand
Hold on
It's not that hard to be a friend 
Hold on
So don't give up, stand 'til the end
Hold on
Cause there's more to life than just to live
Hold on

Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

If it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don't forget to
Hold on
Hold on

Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

When you love someone and they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well I'm done
With awkward situations and empty
Conversations

Oooh
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass 
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

So this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M.
Well I'm done 
With texting
Sorry for the miscommunication

Oooh 
This is a S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess 
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
Cause hugs are over-rated just F.Y.I.

Oooh 
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess 
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
Yeah

Oooh
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get



I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Staring me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'ma trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Said we're burnin' up in this place tonight
The brothers singing loud (and we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (don't try and fight it)
Big Rob is for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor)
It keeps on burnin' up (more and more)
I got JB with me laying it down
Come on boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeah)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (yea, come on, Nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby



Well here we are again 
Throwing punch-lines, no one wins 
As the morning sun begins to rise 
We're fading fast 
We won't work this out 

No we're not gonna work this out tonight 
No we're not gonna make this right 
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye 
(Give a kiss and say goodbye)
Cuz we're not gonna work this out tonight 

Every single word's been said (whoa oh oh) 
Broke each others hearts again (whoa oh oohh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine 
We're breaking down 
She screams out 


No we're not gonna work this out tonight 
No we're not gonna make this right 
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye 
(Give a kiss and say goodbye)
Cuz we're not gonna work this out tonight 

We don't have to fight tonight 
We just gotta try tonight
We're gonna work this out 
We don't have to fight tonight
We just gotta try 
Tonight

No we're not gonna work this out tonight 
No we're not gonna make this right 
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye 
(Give a kiss and say goodbye)
Cuz we're not going to work this out tonight 

Well there's no need to fight
We're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well we know we're in love
So let's keep it alive (keep it alive, keep it alive)
Tonight
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out



(Yeah)
(HEY!,  HEY!, HEY!)

I was sittin' at home
Watchin' TV all alone
So tired of re-runs
I memorized this show
So I pick up the phone
Call everyone I know
I say there's gonna be a party
Hit the music 
Here we go
Yeah

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock and roll

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

We were out on the floor
Yeah we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch
And said that it was late

Then she pulled me aside
And said she couldn't stay
But I begged her for
One more song
Let the music play

Yeah

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock and roll

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I drove her home
And then then she whispered in my ear
The part doesn't have to end 
We can dance here

Live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll

You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll

Live! To! Party!



Young hearts, I believe that we are not far
From becoming who we truly are
Love is on its way
Dreamers, you see everything in color
While the world is getting darker
Love is on its way

So hold on another day
'Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be ok
'Cause love is on its way
It's alright you'll find a brighter day
'Cause love is on its way

Leaders, show us how to love each other
It could help us to recover
Love is on its way
Lonely, I believe that you will find me
And together we will truly see
That love is on its way

So hold on another day
'Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be ok
'Cause love is on its way
It's alright you'll find a brighter day
'Cause love is on its way

So hold on another day
'Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be ok
'Cause love is on its way
It's alright you'll find a brighter day
'Cause love is on its way 


Tonight I walked into the bedroom
You were visibly upset
Tellin' me I made a bad move
But I didn't do nothin'
You start screamin' wake the neighbours
Everybody's out for blood
Didn't want no confrontation
'Cause of you that's what I've got

Well you gotta chill out cause baby I don't wanna fight with chyou
And every battle that we fought just made us look like fools

No you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III

Now you're rounding up your army
Turning all your troops on me
Telling lies just to feel happy
But I won't retaliate

No you can't have World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III

Well you gotta chill out 'cause baby I don't wanna fight with chyou
And every battle we fought just made us look like fools

No you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
Not Gonna be a World War III

Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III
World War III


I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freakin' out

It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
I'm paranoid
Yeah!

I take the necessary steps
To get some air in to my chest
I'm taking all the doctor's meds
I'm still freakin' out

That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
Consider me destroyed
(Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act
'Cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
(Must be paranoid)
And I never thought it would come this
I'm paranoid

Stuck in a room of staring faces
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry, running through her street
I'm about to freak, come and rescue me

Just might be paranoid, yeah
(Might be paranoid)
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
(Someone stop the noise)
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
Consider me destroyed
(Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act
'Cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
(Must be paranoid)
I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid


If time was still
The sun would never never find us
We could light up
The sky tonight
If I would see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright
if we chase stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

Gotta fly with me now

Now the past
Can come alive
And give it meaning
And a reason
To given all I can
To believe once again

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright

if we chase the  stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

Maybe you were just afraid
Knowing you were miles away
From the place where you needed to be
And that's right here with me

if it's you and me forever
if it's You and me right now
I 'd be allright
if we  chase stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
if  we chase stars to lose shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly, fly, fly
With me


I just got back from the doctor
He told me that I had a problem
I realized it's you
I tried to scratch away the issue
All I ever get is tissues
So I can wipe away my tears

Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy
Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy
Everybody gets the itch
Everybody hates that
Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy

Now I found out you were lying
When you told me you were trying
Just to medicate the rash
Tangled vines they are deceiving
From the lines that now are leading
To the truth I need to hear

Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy
Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy
Everybody gets the itch
Everybody hates that
Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy
Yow

Yeah, I break out and I start to shake
When I hear your name, I can't walk away
I can't stop even if I try
I lay down my pride.I can't walk way.
I get burned and I have to learn
That the court's adjourned, can't walk away
Tied up in my tangled thoughts
I'm tryin just can't walk way
Poison
Poison
Poison Ivy

Everyone's allergic to
Poison Ivy
Everybody needs a little
Poison Ivy
Everybody wants a little
Poison Ivy
Everybody gets the itch
Everybody hates that
Everybody needs a little
Poison Ivy

Everybody gets the itch
Everybody hates that
Everybody needs a little
Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy

Give me some poison baby!


Yeah

Why you treatin' me bad?
Hey, darlin'
You're making me mad
I'm going crazy
Trying to figure out why you are leavin'
Give me a reason
Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Oh, oh

Hey, baby
What's the matter with you?

Know your love isn't true
I'm going crazy
Trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason
Hey baby
Why you bein' a fool?
Hey darlin'
Always been good to you
I'm going crazy
Trying to figure out why you are leavin'
Give me a reason

Oh, oh, yeah
Hey baby


Yeah-ah-ah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I know this isn't what I wanted
Never thought it'd come this far
Thinkin' back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
Standing here but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
I don't want to lose her
Don't want to let her go

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
Cause I would leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

With every stike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
Not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
Cause I would leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

I'm trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold ya
Like I did before the storm
Yeah
Like I did before the storm


Baby girl I'm just a bit confused
You've been acting like you've been abused
By me lately
What's going on?
All I do is treat you with respect
All the best and never nothing less
But you continue to cry
And I just don't know why

What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?

All I ever get is attitude
Constant never ending bad mood
From you baby
What's going on?
All I need is just an answer please
So I can show you what you mean to me
But you continue to cry
And I just don't know why

What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?

(What did I do to your...)
(What did I do to your...) Heart

What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Tell me what did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?


I get a rep for breakin' hearts
Now I'm done with superstars
And all the tears on her guitar
I'm not bitter
But now I see
Everything I'd ever need
Is the girl in front of me
She's much better

You
I wanna fly with
You
Tear up the sky with
You
You're much better
You
I wanna fight with
You
Make up tonight with
You
You're much better

Now I've got some enemies
And they're all friends suddenly
BFF's eternally
But I'm not bitter
I believe that the road that people lead
Helps you find the one you need
You're much better
Yeah

You
I wanna fly with
You
Tear up the sky with
You
You're much better
You're much better, girl
You
I wanna fight with
You
Make up tonight with

You're much better, girl
Oh

You

You
You're much better

You
You
You're much better


She walks away
Colors fade to gray
Every precious moment's now a waste
She hits the gas hoping it would pass
The red lights starts to flash
It's time to wait

'Cause black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no
A world I never knew

She hates the sun cause it proves she's not alone
And the world doesn't revolve around her soul
She loves the sky cause it validates her pride
Never lets them know when she is wrong

'Cause black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no
Yeah
And the walls are closing in

Don't let them get inside of your head
Don't let them get inside of your head
Don't let them get inside of your head
Don't let them inside

'Cause black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew
Don't let them get (Don't let them get)
Inside of your head (No)
Don't let them get inside of your head
Don't let them get (Don't let them get)
Inside of your head
Don't let them get (No)
Inside of your head
Sometimes a fight is better black and white


This is life in this world
Some things go right
Some things go wrong
It's just how the world can be
People just want to be free
Yeah...

The verdict came in and it said I was guilty
I looked at the judge, "Hey America built me."
Tried to get rich but they label me filthy
Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me...
My friend calls me at 9 o'clock
Says,"Get the car it's time to rock"
Never heard him speak this way
I grab the keys and hit the road
It's all a flash but who would know
How the story would unfold

Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime

My friend gets in the car with bags
Filled to the top with loads of cash
And throws his pistol on the dash
Says, "I'm sorry for the crime
That I've involved you in this time
You're the only friend I've got"

So don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime

I start to freak and scream so loud
Just like the females in the crowd
That's when he gets in my head
You could live just like a king with everything
You'd ever need
All the dreams of every man

Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time, uh, yeah
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time, you know, uh
Don't charge me...

Siren sound and my heart was poundin'
I looked at my man as the cops surround him
A teen on the scene with no objective
The American dream can be so deceptive
Now I see the flashing lights
There goes my future and my life
Now I've gotta do what's right
I stop the car and throw the keys
Out of the window sets me free
I throw the pistol in the back
Throws me out of the car
You know me well
I'm not going to jail
I'm not paying your bail
Believe me when I say

They won't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me...
Wrong place wrong time
Don't charge me for the...
Crime


Pick up all your tears
Throw em in your back seat
Leave without a second glance
Somehow I'm to blame
For this never-ending racetrack you call life

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might fall off this track sometime
Hope to see you on the finish line

You're driving all your friends out
You just be, you cannot follow
And soon you will be on your own
Somehow I'm to blame
For this never-ending racetrack you call life

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might fall off this track sometime
Hope to see you on the finish line

I did all I could
I gave everything
But you had to go your way
And that road was not for me

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you on the finish line


I thought I was cool
But I just looked a fool
For so long
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Yeah...

Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me

I recall all our fights
Most of all, all the times
You would lie in my arms
Now you're gone
You're gone
Yeah

Don't speak to me
Don't be my aim

There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light
It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
'Cause our love won't survive
Yeah
Our love won't survive
Don't speak a word

Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me

There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light
It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
'Cause our love won't survive


There came a day when the songs that you play
Are blasting through the speakers in your car
It comes in a flash and you hear the crowd
Screaming out your name for the encore

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Hold on tight
Don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright but still keep it real

Who could know that you'd be on the road
Selling out the tickets to your show
Where you're from you're still the one
You were before you left to go on tour

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Hold on tight
Don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright but still keep it real

Did you ever think your dreams
Would become a reality?
All you did was just believe

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Yeah

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Hold on tight
Don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright but still keep it real


I want someone to love me
For who I am
I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?

I want to break our madness
But it's all I have
I want someone to love me
For who I am

Nothing makes sense
Nothing makes sense anymore
Nothing is right
Nothing is right when you're gone

Loosing my breath
Loosing my right to be born
I'm frightened to death
I'm frightened that I won't be strong

I want someone to love me
For who I am
I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?

I want to break our madness
But it's all I have
I want someone to love me
For who I am

Are you going to love me
Yeah
For who I am?

I want someone to love me
For who I am
I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?

I want to break our madness
But it's all I have
I want someone to love me
For who I am


Heeey
This is the night! 
This is the night! 
Heeey

I'm feelin' alive

My heart goes boom as the stars go blue,
Like a sea of cell phone lights,
The moon gets light as the sun goes down,
Somewhere behind the Hollywood sign

Have you ever felt kept down?
I know sometimes it feels like a battle,
But it can turn around,

Heeey

The kick drum starts as the boulevard,
Fills up with all the boys and girls
From the Jersey town to the L.A. crowd,
They hear us all over the world,
Have you ever felt like standing on a rooftop,
Have you ever wanted to scream?
Everybody dance, burn it up till we blast off,
Just like a rocket machine (Yeeahh!)

Heeey 
This is the night! 
This is the night! 
Heeey

I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive
'Cause were not alone tonight,
So raise up your hands and touch the sky,
'Cause were not alone tonight,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I never thought I would, did it
Never thought I could
I did it like that, did it like this
Did it like everybody knows
That we got something real, shorty
I know what I feel
So shout it like that
Shout it like this
Listen up, everybody knows
But you, here it goes

Cause I never really noticed
Took a while for me to see
Playing back the moments
Now I'm starting to believe
That you could be at the show and know everyone
But it's you who makes me sing
And I know where we are and I know who I am
Baby, I'm your biggest fan, oh

Every time you smile for me
Takes me a while to bring myself back
Cause you're all that
And I just had to let you know
I'm screaming out in the crowd for you
I can't be too loud but I don't care
I let 'em all stare
I just want everyone to know
The truth, it's only you

I never really noticed
Took a while for me to see
Playing back the moments
Now I'm starting to believe
That you could be at the show and know everyone
But it's you who makes me sing
And I know where we are and I know who I am
Baby, I'm your biggest fan

You showed up and you looked so classy
Made me think twice 'bout the way I was acting
You were real from the start of it all
Like a dream came to life, now I'm left in all
Stars shine but your light is the brightest
Love flies but your love is the highest
You're so sweet that it drives me crazy
A summer like no other, you're my L.A. baby

I never really noticed
Took a while for me to see
Playing back the moments
Now I'm starting to believe
That you could be at the show and know everyone
But it's you who makes me sing
And I know where we are and I know who I am
Baby, I'm your biggest fan, oh
Baby, I'm your biggest fan, oh

That you could be at the show and know everyone
But it's you who makes me sing
And I know where we are and I know who I am
Baby, I'm your biggest fan




There's a storm coming up
and I gotta prepare myself.
'Cause this felling'
getting stronger everyday.

Something's creeping inside
everything is about to change.
Gotta face the fact
that I can't walk away.

This is critical,
I'm feeling helpless.
So hysterical, this can't be healthy.
I can't eat or sleep
when you're not with me.
Baby, you're the air breath.
This is critical, yeah.
So stuck on you.

Used to have everything figured out
but it's different now.
When you came, you saw
you conquered my heart.

It's your laugh and your smile;
wanna stay for a little while.
I don't wanna go,
I just want you in my arms.

This is critical,
I'm feeling helpless.
So hysterical, this can't be healthy.
I can't eat or sleep
when you're not with me.
Baby, you're the air breath.
This is critical, yeah.
So stuck on you.

Used to run and hide.
Used to bend our love.
But I can't run away this time.
Oh no.

This is critical,
I'm feeling helpless.
So hysterical, this can't be healthy.
I can't eat or sleep
when you're not with me.
You're the air breath.
This is critical, yeah.

Baby it's so critical,
it's so critical, yeah.
It's so critical,
it's so critical, yeah




Mic check
Can you hear me?
Gotta know if I'm coming in clearly
Static, through the speakers
In a second, your heart will be fearless
It's taken for granted
Right now, you can't stand it
Breakdown, it's a showdown
Got to scream it out loud
Cause..

I'm not fakin'
Girl, I'm just sayin'

Hey you,
Hey you
Now we're in for somethin' new
Hey you,

Now you're feelin' like I do

Come on (Hey)
Shout it (Oh)
Let's leave the past behind us (Yeah)
Come on (Oh)
Shout it out..
Hey you

Not open to suggestions
I'm dreamin' of you and me dancin'
No one's interferin'
Gotta do it ourselves,
We don't need ´em
Long as we're together
We won't want nobody else, baby
Tell me if you're ready
Cause tonight, you will see..

That I'm not fakin'
Girl, I'm just sayin'

Hey you,
Hey you
Now we're in for somethin' new

Shout it out..
Hey you




Try to fall asleep tonight
Lay awake and dream of a life
Where we thought that we could make it
We wasted all our time
And I wouldn't change a single thing, I know

We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love
And I wish that it could be the way that it was
But it's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
Two wrongs don't make it right
Two hearts are on the line
Maybe we could have made it
Have waited
Done this right
In the end, I'm a friend
But that's all I am to you, oh

We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love
And I wish that it could be the way that it was
But it's over
There's no one to blame
No, it'll never be the same
No, it'll never be the same
(No, no, no, no)

We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love
And I wish I believed you
But it's easy to see that it's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
No, it'll never be the same
No, it'll never be the same

It's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same (x4)


On the edge of something real
I have a choice, but I don't know what to feel
Getting tired of all this fear
Before I choose, let me know that you'll be here
Let me know that you'll be here

Cause I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

When I'm far away from where you are
It's ok, cause we're under the same stars
I'm laying down this heavy load
Maybe now I can finally let this go
I can finally let you know

But I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok

To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh Oh

To fall Oh oh
To fall
To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh Oh
To fall

Not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

Oh Oh Oh (Cause I'm not afraid to fall)
Fall Oh Oh Oh (If you're the one who catches me)
That sometimes it's ok to fall

When I'm about to lose it all
You're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok
It will be okay
That sometimes it's ok, to fall

I'm gonna fall



t's time for something
Time for change
Time to get things rearranged
Oh yeah
The summer heat
Has been gettin' to me
And last summer's love is gone, gone, gone

I've been savin' my love for a rainy day
And it's really comin' down today

Then out of the blue you came
Ya shined a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make
A broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie
This feelin' inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain

I'm blind to some things
Yeah, blind as love
But I can see us livin' it up
Oh yeah
When you're next to me
The butterflies are flyin'
I know everything is fine, fine, fine

I've been savin' my love for a rainy day
Oh yeah
And I've been lookin' for a twist of fate

Then out of the blue you came
Ya shined a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make
A broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie
This feelin' inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain

Ohhh
I wanna live this day forever
Yeah, that would be alright
I'm startin' to love this stormy weather
You are the sunlight
Yeah baby...so come and shine on me
Shine on me

Then out of the blue you came
Ya shined a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make
A broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie
This feelin' inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain (repeat)

Blame it on summer rain
Blamin' it on summer rain, summer rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain (repeat)
Yeah




Yeah, yeah
I was in the background
Quickly fadin' out of view
She with on the front line
Shinin' star of the room
I want to get closer
But there's nothin' I can do
What a shame
Yeah, yeah

Headed for the exit
Guess it's time to hit the road
I wish she was with me
Cuz I, I just never know
I pull the car up
Thinkin' pedal to the floor
About to take off
She opens up the door


She says let's get goin', we got time
But I can see the look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive
C'mon now, yeah

We were in the fast lane
Rollin' to who knows where
No destination
But she don't seem to care
She kept me guessin'
With the moonlight in her eyes
So fierce now
Hey yeah

I start to question
All the things that I don't know
She doesn't answer
She just turns up the radio, yeah

She says let's get goin', we got time
But I can see the look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive
C'mon now, yeah

Sometimes in life
Moments arrive
Things don't turn out the way that you planned
So never think twice
Just get in the car and drive
Come on now, come on now

Listen...
She says let's get goin' we got time
I can see the look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive, yeah
She says let's get going we got time
But I can see the look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
We just can't think twice
So get in the car and drive, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah



I can feel you all around
In the silence I hear the sound
Of your foot steps on the ground
And my heart slows down
So now I'm

I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

Somethings changing deep inside
All my hopes are coming alive
As were fading into the night
I can see your eyes
So I keep on

Waiting for the moonlight 
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl youre not invisible
You're all that I can

See in the darkness
Believe we can make this
All we want it to be
We can stay here forever
Cause we were together
Stuck in this fantasy
I don't wanna leave...

And I'll keep waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl you're not invisible

I'm waiting for the moonlight 
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl you're not invisible 
Girl you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

And my heart slows down..

<!-- PUT LYRICS HERE (and delete this entire line) --



They say you'll know
When you really find the one
But it's hard to tell
With the damage that's been done

But I'd like to say that it's your fault
But I'd know better
'Cause I'm a fool
To think you'd wait around forever

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

Oh
To make it right
Yeah

I didn't know
How good you were for me
Now it's clear
I'm seein' all that we could be

And I know that it's my fault
But I'm gonna treat you better
'Cause if I had one wish
You'd be with me forever

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

Oh
Is there something I could say?
Show me how to break it down
So before you walk away
Take the time to turn around
Listen to me now

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

Oh
To make it right

Make it right

Gonna make it right
Oh, yeah

Driving down the boulevard
Solo
She pulls up in her daddy's car
Top down
I said you got friends and I've got mine
And I've got nothing on my mind 
Rocking out to my favorite song
Is all I really need
But it'd be better if you roll with me

We got the words if you got the melody
We got the time if you got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We got tonight to make every memory 
Ready or not cause we're gonna make you see
That we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off
(We're gonna set this party off)

She looked at me like I was so
Crazy
But I could tell she was in cause she didn't say no
Right away
She told me she would think about it
Girls like that they gotta keep you guessing
And then she blasted her favorite song
But I still heard her scream
Baby you can come with me

We got the words if you got the melody
We got the time if you got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Til we set it off
We got tonight to make every memory 
Ready or not cause we're gonna make you see
That we're not gonna stop
Until we set this party off

All I need is my favorite song
But it sounds better when you sing along
Sing along

We got the words if you got the melody
We got the time if you got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Til we set it off
We got tonight to make every memory 
Ready or not cause we're gonna make you see
That we're not gonna stop
Gonna set this party off
We got the words if you got the melody
We got the time if you got the place to be
We got tonight to make every memory 
No we're not gonna stop 
Until we set this party off

I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freakin' out

It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
I'm paranoid
Yeah!

I take the necessary steps
To get some air in to my chest
I'm taking all the doctor's meds
I'm still freakin' out

That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
Consider me destroyed
(Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act
'Cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
(Must be paranoid)
And I never thought it would come this
I'm paranoid

Stuck in a room of staring faces
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry, running through her street
I'm about to freak, come and rescue me

Just might be paranoid, yeah
(Might be paranoid)
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
(Someone stop the noise)
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
Consider me destroyed
(Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act
'Cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
(Must be paranoid)
I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

Tonight I walked into the bedroom
You were visibly upset
Tellin' me I made a bad move
But I didn't do nothin'
You start screamin' wake the neighbours
Everybody's out for blood
Didn't want no confrontation
'Cause of you that's what I've got

Well you gotta chill out cause baby I don't wanna fight with chyou
And every battle that we fought just made us look like fools

No you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III

Now you're rounding up your army
Turning all your troops on me
Telling lies just to feel happy
But I won't retaliate

No you can't have World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III

Well you gotta chill out 'cause baby I don't wanna fight with chyou
And every battle we fought just made us look like fools

No you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
Not Gonna be a World War III

Every time you attack
Doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III
World War III


A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In southern california, much like arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour

When i'm thinkin' 'bout you
(ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (ahead)
'cause i been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (ahead)
'cause i been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)

No, i don't like you, i just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house i could sell you in idaho
Since you think i don't love you, i just thought you were cute
That's why i kiss you
Got a fighter jet, i don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you
(ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (ahead)
'cause i been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (ahead)
'cause i been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could i forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
'til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead? (ahead)
'cause i been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (ahead)
'cause i been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)


Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

When I thought it'd all been done
when I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so close
And every time you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know (no, no)
You don't even know

All this time goes by
Still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

Waiting on a cure
But none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know (no, no)
You don't even know (no, no)
You don't even know (no, no)


Yeah!

But you don't what you got till it's gone,
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile you laugh you glow
You don't even know! Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Know! 
Oh, yeah, yeah
You don't even know, no

So I'll wait till kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be... fine



If the heart is always searching, 
Can you ever find a home? 
I've been looking for that someone, 
I'll never make it on my own. 
Dreams can't take the place of loving you, 
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes, 
And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When you look me in the eyes, 
I catch a glimpse of heaven. 
I find my paradise, 
When you look me in the eyes. 

How long will I be waiting, 
To be with you again 
Gonna tell you that I love you, 
In the best way that I can. 
I can't take a day without you here, 
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear. 

When you look me in the eyes, 
And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When you look me in the eyes, 
I catch a glimpse of heaven. 
I find my paradise, 
When you look me in the eyes. 

More and more, I start to realize, 
I can reach my tomorrow, 
I can hold my head up high, 
And it's all because you're by my side. 

When you look me in the eyes, 
And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go 

Cause when you look me in the eyes. 

And tell me that you love me. 
Everything's alright, 
When you're right here by my side. 
When you look me in the eyes, 
I catch a glimpse of heaven. 
I find my paradise, 
When you look me in the eyes. 


I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Staring me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'ma trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Said we're burnin' up in this place tonight
The brothers singing loud (and we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (don't try and fight it)
Big Rob is for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor)
It keeps on burnin' up (more and more)
I got JB with me laying it down
Come on boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeah)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (yea, come on, Nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby



Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
Felt so close but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless, over the edge, I'm just
breathless, I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
hopeless, head over heels in the moment,
I never thought that I'd get hit, by this love bug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
[I can't get you out of my mind]
I think about your eyes all the time
you're beautiful but you don't even try
(don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

Now I'm speechless, over the edge I'm just,
breathless, I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
hopeless, head over heels in the moment,
I never thought that I'd get hit by, this love bug again

Kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby cant you see

Now I'm...

Now I'm speechless, over the edge of this,
breathless, i never thought that I'd catch this, love bug again
and now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment,
i never thought that I'd get hit, by this love bug again
[ohhhhh]
Love Bug again
[woo!]



Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well I'm done
With awkward situations and empty
Conversations

Oooh
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass 
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

So this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M.
Well I'm done 
With texting
Sorry for the miscommunication

Oooh 
This is a S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess 
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
Cause hugs are over-rated just F.Y.I.

Oooh 
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess 
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
Yeah

Oooh
This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you 
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get



Somebody find a waiter
Our lips are dry
Another round for the table
Hold the ice
Pardon me 'cause I'm staring
Oh my god
I can marry that smile you're wearing
And I just might

[Chorus:]
Wow
Look at us right now
Finally we're found, found, found, found, found
Run
Go ahead and run around
See how quick you're found, found, found, found, found

Sophisticated California
The kids gotta grow
This kinda life is bound to bore you
Yeah, I should know
But you always seem to break the rhythm
Of this messed up world
And there's no way that I'm ever leaving
Without you girl and...

[Chorus:]
Wow
Look at us right now
Finally we're found, found, found, found, found (finally)
Run
Go ahead and run around
And see how quick you're found, found, found, found, found

Tell me you want me to love you
Tell me you'll never stop
I'll be around yeah you're never lost

[Chorus:]
Wow
Look at us right now
Finally we're found, found, found, found, found
Baby, you should run
Go ahead and run around
And see how quick you're found, found, found, found, found, yeah -->



You can't stop the world
You can't do it all alone
It's too heavy for,
you to carry on on your own

But tonight you are mine
The world will be fine
It’s just us in this moment, so

Don’t think about the world
Stop blaming yourself, I know you do
Don’t think about the world
Just me and you, (hey) tonight

No I can’t fly
I can’t swim across the sea
I don’t wonder why
It’s just the way it’s gotta be
I love that you care
Not know that you scared
It’s just us in this moment

Hey, hey, hey

Don’t think about the world
Stop blaming yourself, I know you do
Don’t think about the world
Just me and you, (hey) tonight

Don’t stress for nothing
Let me take you away
From all the madness
Just give me today
Cause you’re all I want
You’re all I need
Right here right now
It’s you and me, so

Don’t think about the world
Stop blaming yourself, I know you do
Don’t think about the world
Just me and you, don't think about the world
Just me and you, tonight


Pardon my interruption
This drink's just settling in
On my reservations,
A reason I don't exist...

She says, "Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know it's a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon..."

No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!

Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light,
Instead of you in white.
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime.

The wedding bells... wedding bells... wedding bells...

Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if I'm being honest
I'm hoping that I'd get caught
Showing you I'm unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June

No, I don't wanna love if it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try one last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime...

The wedding bells chimeeeee... yeah... the wedding bells...

No, I don't wanna love if it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try one last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
Trying to fall asleep, you wake me up and I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No, I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime, the wedding bells...
The wedding bells... wedding bells...


Keys to an open door
That don’t need a lock
Stains on a dirty floor
You don’t see a spot
What do I mean?
What do I mean to you?

Waging a war inside you
But don’t see the scars
You’ve got the moon to guide you
Who needs the stars?
What do I mean?
Tell me, what do I mean to you?

What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I?..
What do I mean to you?

No need for water, Peter
You got the wine
Searching for diamonds
When I gave you the mine
What do I mean?
Tell me, what do I mean to you, to you?

I'm a believer, Jesus (hallelujah)
Show me the light
Side of the road
The Devil gave you a ride
What do I mean (what do I mean)?
Tell me, what do I mean (what do I mean) to you?

(Hallelujah)

What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I?..
What do I mean to you?

A child needs a mother
And you want trust but not the truth
I’m just a lover
So what do I mean to you?

What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?


Stars fade
Hearts break
Fair trade

So neon, neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all I can see is
Neon, neon

Hope tonight you're gonna show me just
You're always here glowing in the dark

And make my choice to live,
All of my own life

Every year at Christmas
All I can see
Are pictures of the things I want
Around the tree
But this year's a little different
I'm not thinking of myself
So my prayer for this Christmas 
Is for somebody else

(Chorus)
So I pray...
Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl
Hope when life is hard
Light when everything seems dark

God I know you're listening
And you can hear
The need of every broken heart
And all their tears
I don't have a lot to offer
Just this one simple prayer
That this Christmas everyone would know 
Somebody cares...

(Chorus)
So I pray...
Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl
Hope when life is hard
Light when everything seems dark

I pray that every hungry soul 
Will be filled and will be warm

That not a single, solitary child 
Would suffer harm

And Lord we find their ending
As we take another view
My hope is that this Christmas prayer
Would somehow come true

I pray...
Humanity would rise
And join with me
And together we'll sing

Joy To the World (To all the world)
Peace (Peace) for every boy and girl (for every boy and girl)
(Talking bout hope) Hope when life is hard (when life is hard)
Light when everything seems dark

I pray that (I pray) every hungry soul 
Will be filled and will be warm
(Not a single child) That not a single, solitary child 
Would suffer harm

And Lord we find their ending
As we take another view
My hope is that this Christmas prayer
Would somehow come true...

Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl

(spoken) 
Listen, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had my heart broken. So, to all the others who have out there, this is for you!! 

I called and I texted. I got us connected. 
I'm so sorry I couldn't be there.. for you. 
It wasn't my choice to be gone.. from you. 
I know that I told you I'd be there. 
I was a promise.. I still care! 
I'm sorry for breaking the promises I wasn't around to keep. 
I wanted to tell you, "I love you," 
But the connection was weak! 

I'm Sorry! It didn't turn out the way that I wished. 
I'm sorry! At least we had that perfect kiss. 
I'm still in love with you. 
I'd do anything for you! 
And, BABY, I'm sorry... 

I know that.. I broke a promise that meant something to you. 
And if you were to say, I need you, I would have said it too.. 

I'm Sorry! It didn't turn out the way that I wished. 
I'm sorry! At least we had that perfect kiss. 
I'm still in love with you. 
I'd do anything for you! 
And, BABY, I'm sorry... 

I'm Sorry! It didn't turn out the way that I wished. 
I'm sorry! At least we had that perfect kiss. 
I'm still in love with you. 
I'd do anything for you! 
And, BABY, I'm sorry... 

Listen girl, you mean the world... to me!

Dance Until Tomorrow is a song by the Jonas Brothers that leaked in December 2011. It isn't on any songs, as it's leaked. 



Dance untill tomorow

Calling you out, calling you out
So you can see what's going on
Breaking it down, breaking it down
Cause I can see that something's wrong 

Your body's moving but your mind is somewhere else
And I don't know how to get there
It's like you're losing yourself

(Chorus)
Oh oh, no I never thought we would come this far
Oh oh, got enough of me to break my heart
Oh oh, when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing until tomorrow

Calling you out, calling you out
Cause I can see we're near the end
Letting me down, letting me down
It's like we're back to one again 

Your body's moving but your mind is somewhere else
And I don't know how to get there
It's like you're losing yourself

(Chorus)
Oh oh, no I never thought we would come this far
Oh oh, got enough of me to break my heart
Oh oh, when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing until tomorrow

Oh oh, no we're not gonna stop till they hit the lights
Oh oh, when the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
Oh oh, when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing until tomorrow 

(Chorus)
Oh oh, no I never thought we would come this far
Oh oh, got enough of me to break my heart
Oh oh, when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing until tomorrow

Oh oh, no we're not gonna stop till they hit the lights
Oh oh, when the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
Oh oh, when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing until tomorrow 

Keep dancing until tomorrow

Oh oh, no we're not gonna stop till they hit the lights
Oh oh, when the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
Oh oh, when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing until tomorrow


She's such a flirt 
I am the lonely heart 
Give it a chance 
For our love to start 
You'll never see 
If you don't give me a shot 
To show you what I got 

It's too late to pretend. 
You know me better than I know myself. 
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf. 
Always someone else 
The next guy who will 
Make your cold heart melt 
I'm gonna give my love to someone else. 

I held your hand 
It felt like a movie 
I made some plans 
But you were already moving on 
Now I'm stuck under a rainy cloud 
But you don't seem to care 
But it's all I can take 

I'm tired of wasting all my time 
My heart is hanging on the line 
Is it me, girl, or someone else?
Don't leave it on the shelf. 

It's too late to pretend 
You know me better than I know myself 
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf 
Baby, see? 
How much it hurts to be alone like me? 
So go ahead and put your heart on a shelf 

La la la la la 
La la la la la 

Always someone else 
The next guy 
Who will make your cold heart melt 
I'm gonna give my love to someone else yeah



I've wrote these lyrics for you
All by myself
What makes you think I need you
Or anybody else
When you see me walking 
Just staring at my feet
Cause I'm not all about you
I'm already complete

I hope this doesn't make you cry
But I don't wanna make you mine
I've told you for the millionth time
That I don't need you in my life

But you can see through me
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid 
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

I wake up thinking of you
And that wears me out
I try hard not to call you
But I can't do without
Hearing your voice tell me
That I am on your mind
It wouldn't work to rush this
I'll come around in time

I hope that you can understand
Right now I don't know where I stand
I'd rather hide behind these walls
Pretending I don't care at all

But you can see through me
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid 
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Life keeps going on
The world keeps spinning 'round
Can't we stop going in circles
Am I afraid of what they'll say
Or too confused to see
You and me

But you can see through me
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid 
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

But you can see through me
(but you can see through me)
How you get to me
(how you get to me)
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid 
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone




Feeling like you've lost your way
See that you've had better days
You dont know why.

Everything seems way too hard
You start to wonder who you are and why you try.

I understand the way you feel
And I can help you keep it real
And help you seen everything you're missing here
Help you take away your fear and set you free.

Find a way back to your heart.
That's a start.
That's where the answers are.

(Chorus):Don't walk away from what you once believed.
Just call my name and I will help you see.
Keep your head up, keep your game on.
Don't turn your back on faith.
Don't walk away.

I know that life can be so hard.
People they may tear you apart and turn you round.
I will be here for you always. All you gotta do is call my name out loud.

Find a way back to your heart.
That's a start.
That's where the answers are.
(Chorus)

(Bridge):Don't you walk away.
You will find away.
Don't you walk away.
I know that life will test your faith.
Don't you walk away.
I'll help you find your way.
Don't walk away.

Don't walk away. You can call my name. I
Can help you, help you figure it out. Dont you walk away you can call my name. I can help you, help you turn it around.
In your heart is where the answers are. Don't turn your back on your faith.
(Chorus)
Don't walk away from what you once believed. Don't you walk away



Looking at a picture 
Of you in my hands
Wonder if I'm ever gonna see you again
Without you, I don't know how my life would be
But I believe

It's not goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

So close, but so far
But here in my heart, you're here with me
You did not leave
You just went to live in eternity
Without you, I don't know how my life would be
But I believe

It's not goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

We will live in the light of the sun again
Dancing in the river of life and
Knowing you'll never leave
Forever by my side, I'll never have to say

Goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

Goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity



You, you like driving on a Sunday
You, you like taking off on Monday
You, you're like a dream, a dream come true

I was just a face you never notice
Now I'm just trying to be honest
With myself, with you, with the world

You might think that I'm a fool
For falling over you
So tell me what I can do to prove to you
That it's not so hard to do?

Give love a try, one more time
'Cause you know that I'm on your side
Give love a try, one more time

How did it play out like a movie?
Now every time you speak it moves me
And I can't get your smile off my mind

And your eyes, when I saw 'em for the first time
Knew that I was gonna love you for a long time
With a love so real, so right

Well, you might think that I'm a fool
For falling over you
So tell me what I can do to prove to you
That it's not so hard to do?

Give love a try, one more time
'Cause you know that I'm on your side
Give love a try, one more time
One more time


Hollywood, as time was tickin' 
We were winning 
And it all was going as planned 
Politicians stand between our 
Lines of making headlines 
Street signs saying your 
Going the 
Wrong way fading 
Faster now. 

You can try to break us 
And make us fall apart but the fire's in our hearts 
Reminisce on memories 
Cuz we're gone 
Don't forget to 
Hold back your thoughts 
And live like robots 
Cuz we all know what goes on 
Reminisce our memories 
Cuz we're gone 
We're gone 
So gone 

Fallin soldiers 
All around us 
But we're still standing strong 
Embarrassing and contradicting 
Cuz now we're making headlines 
Primetime saying what a story 
Billboards packed tours 
Don't forget 

You can try to break us 
And make us fall apart but the fire's in our hearts 
Reminisce on memories 
Cuz we're gone 

Don't forget to 
Hold back your thoughts 
And live like robots 
Cuz we all know what goes on 
Reminisce on memories 
Cuz we're gone 
We're gone 
So gone 

Game over 
Your done 
Outta left field 
We won 
Pack our bags yeah we'll run 
Hollywood here we come 

You can try to break us 
And make us fall apart but the fire's in our hearts 
Reminisce on memories 
Cuz we're gone 
Don't forget to 
Hold back your thoughts 
And live like robots 
Cuz we all know what goes on 
Reminisce on memories 
Cuz we're gone 
We're gone 

You can try to break us 
And make us fall apart but the fires in our hearts 
Reminisce on memories 
Cuz we're gone

Everytime I think I'm closer to the heart
Of what it means to know just who I am
I think I've finally found a better place to start
But no one ever seems to understand

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be, your not that far

You're the voice I hear inside my head, the reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need, the song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

Oh yeah
Yeah yeah

You're the remedy I'm searching hard to find
To fix the puzzle that I see inside
Painting all my dreams the color of your smile
When I find you It'll be alright
I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be, your not that far

You're the voice I hear inside my head, the reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need, the song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

Been feeling lost, can't find the words to say
Spending all my time stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I want to be
Oh next to you... and you next to me
Oh I need to find you... yeah

You're the voice I hear inside my head, the reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you (yeah)
You're the missing piece I need, the song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

You're the voice I hear inside my head, the reason that I'm singing
I need to find you (I need to find you)
I gotta find you (I gotta find you)
You're the missing piece I need, the song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

Yeah, yeah... I gotta find you



Gather 'round, guys
It's time to start listinin'
Practice makes perfect
But perfect's not workin'
There's a law out 'bout music
That know where your cue's gonna be

You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you move with me
But if you can jump
Like David Lee Roth
Or pump your fist like your broom's the boss

If you got a heart and soul
You can rock and roll

Rock and roll

Strummin'
Drummin'
Slide across from runnin'
The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the greats did
There's no way that you can fake it

You've got to feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes
Makin' mistakes
But that won't matter
If you can swagg like 'ol Mick Jagger

If you got a heart and soul
You can rock and roll
You can rock and roll

If you live and you die
For the music inside
If the one four five never gets sold
Then you can rock and roll
Rock and roll

Alright now take it low
Now I need the spotlight to hit me
Right here
As the crowd starts to cheer
I need the fan to blow right through my rock star
hair
Right here

If you can scream like Axl Rose
Or sing like Cristina a show after show
If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock and roll

If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock and roll

You can rock and roll

When we were growing up
I said a lot of things that i didn't mean
I tried to make you tough
But instead i left you crying and lonely
With the heart that's beating
Inside of you
It's too good to be true
You're more beautiful than anything i've seen

Hey little brother

But hey little brother
I need to say i love you
I just want you to know that
Want you to know that
Want you to know that

I did a lot of things 
That i regret now

I always found a way to hurt you somehow
But the man you've grown up
And you have become
Since you were young

You're more beautiful
Than anything i've seen

Think about it,
There must be higher love.
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above.
Without it,
Life is wasted time.
Look inside you're heart and I'll look in mine.

Things look so bad everywhere.
In this whole world what is fair?
We walk the line and we try to see.
Fallen behind what could be?

Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

The worlds turning, 
And we're just hanging on.
Facing out fear,
Standing out there alone.
Yearning, and its real to me.
Must be someone
Who's feeling for me.

Things look so bad everywhere.
In this whole world what is fair?
We walk the line and we try to see.
Fallen behind what could be?

Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
I've got higher love, higher love.

I will wait, forever.
I'm not too late for bed.
Until then I'll sing my song.
To spend the night alone.

Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Where's that higher love I've been thinking of?

Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of.

Bring me a higher love. (Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love. (Whoo!)
Bring me a higher love. (Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love.

Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love.
Bring me a higher love

Love showed up at my door yesterday
It might sound cheesy, but I wanted her to stay
I fell in love with the pizza girl,
Now I eat pizza every day.
I fell in love with the pizza girl,
Now I eat pizza every day.
I was stuck in a box for so long,
Now, I say that the pizza girl
She's the one for me.
I fell in love with the pizza girl,

Now I eat pizza every day (Oh)
I fell in love with the pizza girl,
Now I eat pizza
Now I eat pizza
Now I eat pizza
Every day


Every time I think I'm closer to the heart
Of what it means to know just who I am
I think I've finally found a better place to start
But know one ever seems to understand

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be, you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you, I gotta find you

You're the missin' piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you, oh yeah

You're the remedy I'm searchin' hard to find
To fix the puzzle that I see inside
Painting all my dreams the color of your smile
When I find you it will be alright

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be, you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you, I gotta find you

You're the missin' piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you, oh yeah

Been feelin' lost, can't find the words to say
Spendin' all my time stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I wanna be
Oh, next to you and you next to me
Oh, I need to find you, yeah

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you, need to find you, I gotta find you

You're the missin' piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'

I gotta find you, gotta find you

You're the missin' piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

Yeah, yeah I gotta find you


London's nice but it's not sunny
The desert's hot 'cause there's no rain
You can laugh but it's not funny
I've found a place where my heart will stay

Tokyo's fast but I'm not winded
New York's cash but that's okay
Italy's a priceless memory
Just go walk the streets of Spain

But I've found
That I left my heart in Scandinavia
Left my heart in Scandinavia
Left my love inside of her arms

Yeah, I left my heart in Scandinavia
In Scandinavia

Yeah, I left my heart
In Scandinavia


I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
A hippopotamus is all i want
I don't want a dog or rhinoceros
All i want for Christmas is a hippopotamus
And a hippopotamus wants me too

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
A hippopotamus is all i want
I don't want a dog cause dogs are such a fuss
All I want for Christmas is a hippopotamus
And a hippopotamus wants me too

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh the joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
A hippopotamus is all I want
I don't want a dog or a rhinoceros
All I want for Christmas is a hippopotamus
And a hippopotamus wants me too


I met you in a dream
And your piercing eyes were staring straight at me
I cant believe this feeling
You make me feel so much heat
I want you always near me
Is this really what it seems?

Every year at Christmas
All I can see
Are pictures of the things I want
Around the tree
But this year's a little different
I'm not thinking of myself
So my prayer for this Christmas 
Is for somebody else

So I pray
Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl

God I know you're listening
And you can hear
The need of every broken heart
And all their tears
I don't have a lot to offer
Just this one simple prayer
That this Christmas everyone would know 
Somebody cares

So I pray
Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl
Hope when life is hard
Light when everything seems dark

I pray that every hungry soul 
Will be filled and will be warm
That not a single, solitary child 
Would suffer harm

And Lord we find their ending
As we take another view
My hope is that this Christmas prayer
Would somehow come true

I pray
Humanity would rise
And join with me
And together we'll sing

Joy To the World (To all the world)
Peace (Peace) for every boy and girl (for every boy and girl)
(Talking bout hope) Hope when life is hard (when life is hard)
Light when everything seems dark

I pray that (I pray) every hungry soul 
Will be filled and will be warm
(Not a single child) That not a single, solitary child 
Would suffer harm

And Lord we find their ending
As we take another view (Can we take another view)
My hope is that this Christmas prayer
Would somehow come true

Joy To the World
Peace for every boy and girl


Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her king

Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, morr and mountain

Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And Heaven and nature sing (heaven and nature sing)
Let Heaven and nature sing

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never

Bearing gifts we travel so far.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain, 
Following yonder star.

Joy to the world! The Lord is come! 
Let earth receive her King! 
(Yeah!)
Let every heart prepare him room! 
Let heaven and nature sing.
Let heaven and nature sing.
Let heaven and nature sing.

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, 
Gold I bring to crown Him again, 
King forever, ceasing never

Let every heart prepare him room! 
And heaven and nature sing.

I saw you there, you walked away.
There was nothing I could say.
You call me just to say you're mad at me.
Baby, Baby, can't you see?
That the truth is I did nothing wrong..
Why can't we just get along?
I want to make this simple,
But you're just too complex.
We'd make-up and then I'd ask.. what's next?

Chorus:
Baby, Sweety, Honey, you let me down!
Baby, Sweety, Honey, you let me down!
I didn't wanna knock you to the ground.
But girl, you let me down.

My friends would say..
what are you doing after school?
I'd say, let's hang out.
But remembered.. Baby, you make all the rules!
You've tried to change everything about me.
Baby, why can't you just see?
You knocked me down!
You let me down!


{Repeat Chorus}

Girl, I know I wasn't the best for you.
But did I deserve all you put me through?
I tried and you said, that's not good enough.
Sometimes, girl, you can be a little rough.

{Repeat chorus 2x}




Word on the street is that you aren't into me anymore 
You promise you'd come to me anytime, anywhere 
That was before 
? ? 
But I'm getting by 

CHORUS 
But you're making it seem 
Like I'm letting you down 
And telling your friends 
That I'm never around 
How can I find the right things to say? 
I don't even know that you're feeling this way 
Baby, I'm tired of letting you down 

It's a shame that you're lying 
You keep on denying you tell me it's cool 
You told all our secrets and weaknesses baby I feel like a fool 
Oooh and all the signs I've been reading between the lines 
From the start, I gave you my heart 

CHORUS 

I've played these games before 
And we know better 
We want to live and talk and stay together 
I'm trying to change your mind 
But you're hiding all the time 
You know it's true 
I'm crazy for you 

[Talking] 
I'll try to be alright just stay around 

How can I find the right things to say? 
I don't even know that you're feeling this way 
Baby, I'm tired of letting you down 

Don't even know that I'm letting you down 

Tell your momma, your daddy, your sister 
You tell 'em that I'm letting you down girl 

How can I find the right things to say? 
I don't even know that you're feeling this way 
Baby, I'm tired of letting you down 

Tell your momma, your daddy, your sister 
You tell 'em that I'm letting you down girl [x6]


[VERSE 1]
Oh, we?re breakin? up
It's so easy
Now, we're making faces
Just to get back together

[BRIDGE]
Oh, when the color turns to grey
When the color fade away
We just get over it
And start again

[Chorus]
Oh, when we fight we look away
What's in our mind baby?
Why, do you have to look away?
Yeah us, we're the one who's different
We're the one who's meant to be
But why, do you need to look away?

Look away, baby why?

[VERSE 2]

Oh, my intensions breaking down
It?s so hard to believe it
I say now, we?re letting lies
Make up our mind

[BRIDGE]
Oh, tell me what is in to you
Tell me what are you hiding
Let?s just get over it
And start again
[Chorus]

Look away
When the color turns to grey
When color fade away
Tell me what is in to you
Tell me what are you hiding
We look away
[Chorus 2x]


I make up one more lame excuse
Why can't come out tonight
I'm not trying to cut you loose
I just need some time

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm feeling love sick but I don't mind
You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
Oh, call the, the doctor
I'm love sick

Yeah
I'm love sick
Going back and for so long
And you're getting over
Waiting on me to be strong
And you start to wonder

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm feeling love sick but I don't mind
You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
O-oh, call the the doctor
I'm love sick

Whoo
You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
Oh, call the doctor
I'm love sick


Called you for the first time yesterday
I finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you outta my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

Now I'm speechless over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby can't you see?
Now I'm

Now I'm speechless over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again
Oh! Lovebug again


Shes there,
she is always on my mind,
she doesnt know how i feel yet,
but of course she doesnt do anything,
she may be younger then me but i love her,
shes my baby boo,
ILOVE YOU,



Time has come to an end
This world has started to go
Do not worry because if you try
You are in God's hands
(Believe in miracles)
No more letters to send
No more green earth life
It's the end my dear, dear friend
Hope we'll all be fine

It's the end of the world
It's the end of the time
It's the end of the Generation
It's the end of life
But what you can do is pray
Tell God to save the world
Don't you worry, Hope you'll be alright
Believe in miracles
(Miracles)

No More Clouds
No More Trees
No More Rain or Snow
No More Seeds
(Believe in Miracles)
No more of this Planet
We love it so much
You pray for life but can you
Ever get it back
Cause I know

It's the end of the world
It's the end of the time
It's the end of the Generation
It's the end of life
But what you can do is pray
Tell God to save the world
Don't you worry, Hope you'll be alright
Believe in miracles

Miracles

It's the end, but don't be so sad
This is really it
We use to have sweet dreams
We Believe in what we see

It's the end of the world
It's the end of the time
It's the end of the Generation
It's the end of life
But what you can do is pray
Tell God to save the world
Don't you worry, Hope you'll be alright
Believe in miracles

Miracles
Miracles



Wouldn't it be nice
If I had some tissues
Wipe away the tears
That's right, you've got issues
Why do you keep asking questions
When I don't care

And how many times 
Will it take you
To figure out how much
I hate you
I'm right, you're wrong
Move on

Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right, you're wrong
Move on

Wouldn't it be nice
If you stopped whining
And telling all your friends
That I keep lying
You can trust me when I tell you
We're through (we're through) 

And how many times
Will it take you
To do the math
Me minus you
I'm right, you're wrong 
Move on

Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right, you're wrong
Move on

How many feelings will you harbor
Get over it, your friends are so much hotter
Ohhh yeah ee

I'm right, you're wrong
Move on
I'm right, you're wrong
Move on

Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right, you're wrong
Move on

Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right, you're wrong
Move on

(feat. Demi Lovato)

I didn't wanna say, I'm sorry, for breaking us apart.
I didn't wanna say, it was my fault, even though I knew it was.
I didn't wanna call, you back, 'cuz I knew that I was wrong.
Yeah I knew, I was wrong.

One in the same, never to change.
Our love was beautiful.
We got it all, destined to fall.
Our love was tragical.
Wanted to call, no need to fight.
You know I wouldn't lie.
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line.

Listen baby.
Never would've said forever, if I knew we'd end so fast.
Why did you say, "I love you", if you knew that it wouldn't last?
Baby I just can't hear what you're saying.
The line is breaking up.
Or is that, just us?
Or is that just us?!

One in the same, never to change.
Our love was beautiful.
We got it all, destined to fall.
Our love was tragical.
Wanted to call, no need to fight.
You know I wouldn't lie.
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line.

Try to call again and get in your mailbox.
Like a letter left unread.
Apologies are often open ended,
But this one's better left unsaid.

One in the same, never to change.
Our love was beautiful.
We got it all, destined to fall.
Our love was tragical.
Wanted to call, no need to fight.
You know I wouldn't lie.
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line.
We'll leave it on the line.
(Yeah, oh yeah)
We'll leave it on the line tonight

I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freaking out

It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freaking out

Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines because they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is but I just don't fit

Consider me destroyed
I don't how to act 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid, yeah

I take the necessary steps
To get some air into my chest
Can't hear the thoughts inside my head
I'm still freaking out

That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freaking out

Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines because they just might split
Can someone stop the noise
I don't know what it is but I just don't fit

Consider me destroyed
I don't know how to act 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
And I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

Stuck in a room of staring faces, yeah
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry running through the streets
I'm about to freak, come on rescue me

Just might be paranoid, yeah
I'm avoiding the lines because they just might split
Can someone stop the noise
I don't know what it is but I just don't fit

Consider me destroyed
I don't how to act 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid
I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

Run, run like you do, I'm chasing you
I'm on your tail, I'm gaining faster, you're going nowhere
Try to fix what you've done, turn back the time
The night is gone and then we're falling faster now

You're pushing me away
Every lost word, every single thing you say
Pushing me away
You try to stop it now but it's all in me today
Pushing me away
If you really dont care just say it to my face
Pushing me away
You push push pushing me away

Stop! Tell me the truth cause I'm so confused
Spinning round these walls are falling down and I need
You, more than you know, I'm not letting go,
I'm getting close, so take my hand
And please just tell me why

You're pushing me away
Every lost word, every single thing you say
Pushing me away
You try to stop it now but it's all in me today
Pushing me away
If you really dont care just say it to my face
Pushing me away

You're pushing me away
Every lost word, every single thing you say

You try to stop it now but it's all in me today

I want to be right next to you
With all the obstacles I go through
I'd want to stay
And never walk away

CHORUS: I'll be right next to you
For all of the things we do
We'll never be apart
Cuz this is the start
We'd pretend to fly 
With our wings up high
We'll be together
Whether
You'll Never
Run away...

I can't stop my heart from lovin' you
I hope you feel that way, too
You'll be my valentine
Cuz you'll always be mine...
Mine......

CHORUS: I'll be right next to you
For all of the things we do

We'll never be apart
Cuz this is the start
We'd pretend to fly
With our wings up high
We'll be together
Whether
You'll Never
Run away
AWAY......

CHORUS: I'll be right next to you
For all the things we do
We'll never be apart
Cuz this is the start
We'd pretend to fly
With our wings up high
We be together
Whether
You'll never
Run away............


One day when I came home at lunchtime,
I heard a funny noise.
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was,
One of those rowdy boys.
Stood there with my neighbor Cow Peter,
And a Flux Capacitor.

He told me he built a time machine.
Like one in a film I've seen,
Yeah... he said...

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water.
And your great great great grand daughter,
Is doing fine (doing fine).

He took me to the future in the flux thing, and I saw everything.
Boy bands, and another one and another one ... and another one!
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine,
Like the one in the film I've seen..
Yeah... he said...

He said, I've been to the year 3000.
Not much has changed but they lived under water,
And your great great great grand daughter,
Is doing fine (doing fine).

I took a trip to the strip joint 3000.
This song had gone multi-platinum.
Everybody bought our titty tassels.

It had outsold Jenna Jamison.
I took a trip to the year 3000.
This song had gone multi-platinum.
Everybody bought our 7th album, 7th album, 7th album.

He told me he built a stripper pole.
Like the one in a film I've seen,
Yeah...

I've been to the strip joint 3000.
Not much has changed but they strip under water.
And Im gonna make my daughter,
Work there (Yea)

He said, I've been to the strip joint 3000.
Not much has changed but they strip under water.
And Im gonna make my daughter work there (Yea)
Shes stripping fine (yea)

He said, I've been to the year 3000.
Not much has changed but they lived under water.
And your great great great grand daughter,
Is doing fine (doing fine).

He said, I've been to the year 3000.
Not much has changed but they lived under water.
And your great great great grand daughter,
Is doing fine (doing fine).
Keep on Stripping (YEAAAA)

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Well, yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

And you say that you'd take it all back given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You shouldn've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me

Yeah, and I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You shouldn've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me

Yeah, and I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me, oh

I can't resist, before you go tell me this
Was it worth it? Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You shouldn've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me

Yeah, and I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

It's out the dome
Nick's ring says poned!

Magazines give info
This song really doesn't flow
In every music video
Joe twirls his microphone

Kevin is Mufassah, he's the king of the land

Hand, hand

The boys are singing about souls, they're not unfortunate or poor
Don't make Joe angry or he'll chase you out the door (oh!) Joe and Kevin had their spills, we're glad they're okay

When he rocks out he's always shaking his hair

Rewind July last summer, I saw Santa jumping through my sprinkler
Rudolph, Jack Frost, and a reindeer
Opened up a lemonade stand on my corner
Two cups for a dollar

Open up your eyes
(Crazy summertime)
Don't know what you'll find
Upside down, the weatherman says snow
But it's burning up outside
It's always summertime

Push play, today I saw my girlfriend
At the beach putting sunscreen on a penguin
Just when I thought it couldn't get weirder
I saw the Grinch at the boardwalk with my teacher, weird

Open up your eyes
(Crazy summertime)
Don't know what you'll find
Upside down, the weatherman says snow
But it's burning up outside
It's always summertime
(It's always summertime)
It's always summertime

When my teacher's with the Grinch
(Crazy summertime)
And St. Nick is getting kitsch
(Crazy summertime)
And now Rudolph is getting rich
(Crazy summertime)
All the elves are in Hawaii

Open up your eyes
(Crazy summertime)
Don't know what you'll find
Upside down, the weatherman says snow
But it's burning up outside
(It's crazy summertime)

Open up your eyes
(Crazy summertime)
Don't know what you'll find
Upside down, the weatherman says snow
But it's burning up outside
It's always summertime


(by A-Ha)

We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Try to turn on my TV
To get you out of my head
Feeling something deep inside
That I just won't admit

It's not like I don't wanna come in
(Wanna come in)
I just don't know why I can't
Stop feeling like this

Tell me why
(Why, why)
Does it hurt so bad?
Tell me why
(Why, why)
Does it make me mad?

Tell me why
Tell me why

Now you're off with someone else
And I'm stuck at home
It's getting late and now I'm feeling so alone
Now I can see the storm's not gonna clear
(Not gonna clear)
Dressed in my pain and out of my tears

Tell me why
(Why, why)
Does it hurt so bad?
(You make it hurt so bad)

Tell me why
(Why, why)
Does it make me mad?
Tell me why
Tell me why

Now I'm in pain because
Losing you is not all I lost this time

Tell me why
(Why)
Does it hurt so bad?
Tell me why
(Why)
Does it make me mad?

Why, why
Why, why

Tell me why
(why, why)
Does it hurt so bad?
(Why does it hurt so bad?)

Tell me why
(Why, why)
Does it make me mad?


I've always been the kinda girl that hid my face
So afraid to tell the world what I've got to say
But I have this dream right inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time to let you know, to let you know

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am, there's no way to hold it in
No more hidin' who I wanna be, this is me, yeah

Do you know what it's like to feel so in the dark?
To dream about a life when you're the shining star
Even though it seems like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself, it's the only way

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am, there's no way to hold it in
No more hidin' who I wanna be, this is me

You're the voice I hear inside my head, the reason that I'm singing
I need to find you, I gotta find you
You're the missing piece, I need the song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Empty words, empty promises
Show me that I'm not cut out
For the road of the entertainer
'Cause I'm really not that loud

Too much to do and too little time
Fix it now before it isn't right

Pick up the clock
And mend the broken hand
All we got to do is just believe
That time is on our side

Pick up the clock
And mend the broken hand
All we got to do is just believe
That time is on our side
That time is on our side


You are mine.  Mine forever.  I've always wanted you and i told you i'd be true.  The other night i got my guitar out.

I thought of your beautiful blue eyes and your dark brown hair.  I said "Why can't she be here?"  i need to see you or i'll go crazy hey maybe i can call you and say goodnight i need you and i promise i am true

I saw you on a thursday i believe it was march 19 2002.  i miss you i hope you know i care  when i saw you the first thing i noticed was your simle and your shiny brown hair i need you tonight

True


I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sweep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

Told you I made dinner plans
That don't include your crazy friends
Well I'm done
With awkward situations empty conversations

Ooh! This is an S.O.S.
Don't want a second guess,
This is the bottom line
It's true!
I gave my all for you,
now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass,
better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Nick: I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

Joe: Ooh! This is an S.O.S.
Don't want a second guess,
This is the bottom line
It's true!
I gave my all for you,
now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass,
better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Nick: Yeah

All: That was when I ruled the world

Yeah! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 

I was sitting at home
Watching TV all alone
So excited for re-runs
I've memorized this show

So I pick up the phone
Call everyone I know
Said there's gonna be a party
Hit the music here we go
Yeah! 

Were gonna live to party
Bust your move
Everybody?s in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock n' roll

Hey! Hey! Hey! 

We were out on the floor
And we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch and
Said that it was late
And she pulled me aside
And said she couldn?t stay
(I really gotta go)
But I begged her for one more song
Let the music play! 

Were gonna live to party
Bust your move
Everybody?s in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock n' roll

Hey! Hey! Hey! 

I drove her home
And she whispered in my ear
Party doesn't have to end

They say that life is a two-way street
When you're not sure, you gotta trust your feet
To know the right way

You can keep on moving with your head down
Or you can stop and take a look around
And that's the choice I've made
(I've made, yeah)

It's for that movie inside your head
Making memories we can't forget
But when you can't forget

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for

For every song we let play outside
The melodies we get to write
Every time we sing, oh yeah

The friends we've made, the fun we've had
Remembering's gonna make me laugh
It's a beautiful thing
(So beautiful)

I wanna send it around the world
(Around the world)
'Cause everybody should feel this good
'Cause when you feel this good

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
(This is what we came here for)
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for

No, the fun's just getting started
Just celebrating where we are
And loving where we are

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for

It's what we came here for
It's what we came here
Came here for


If the heart is always searching,
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone,
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you,
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true.

When you look me in the eyes,
And tell me that you love me.
Everything's alright,
When you're right here by my side.
When you look me in the eyes,
I catch a glimpse of heaven.
I find my paradise,
When you look me in the eyes.

How long will I be waiting,
To be with you again
Gonna tell you that I love you,
In the best way that I can.
I can't take a day without you here,
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear.

I can reach my tomorrow,
I can hold my head up high,
And it's all because you're by my side.

When you look me in the eyes,
And tell me that you love me.
Everything's alright,
When you're right here by my side.
When I hold you in my arms,
I know that it's forever.
I just gotta let you know,
I never wanna let you go.

When you look me in the eyes.

And tell me that you love me.
Everything's alright,
When you're right here by my side.
When you look me in the eyes,
I catch a glimpse of heaven.

Oh


Try turn on my TV to get you out of my head
Feeling something deep inside that I just won't admit
It's not like I don't wanna commit (wanna commit)
I just don't why I can't stop feeling like this
Tell me why (why,why)
Does hurt so bad
Tell my why(why,why)
Does it make mad
Tell me why
Tell me why

Now I can see the storms not gonna clear (not gonna clear)
Dressed in my pain
And all of my tears
Tell my why (why,why)
Does hurt so bad (why does it hurt so bad)
Tell me why (why,why)
Does it make me mad


The first time 
That I see your eyes
Then I'm outta sight
The last night
Girl you broke my heart
But I don't care alot
Cause I won't 
Won't let go
Won't let

I just won't let you go
My heart is seperable
Won't let you go
Oh yeah

I just won't
Love you yeah
Love you girl
This time

I just won't let you go
My heart is seperable
Won't let you go
Oh yeah


If time was still
The sun would never never find us
We could light up
The sky tonight
I would see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

If it's you and me forever
If its you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright

We'll chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

Oh yeah
Gonna fly with me now

Now the past
Can come alive
And give it meaning
And a reason
To give all I can
To believe once again

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright

Be alright
We'll chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

Maybe you were just afraid
Knowing you were miles away
From the place where you needed to be
And that's right here with me

It's you and me forever
You and me right now
That'd be alright
We'll chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
We'll chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly
Fly
Fly with me


T all makes sense
Everybody listen to the words she says
Heading towards a consequence
For every bit of ignorance, incompetence 
It's time for us to work it out 

We got to work, work it out
Before the day is done
We got to be a bit stronger
'Cause we'll need it when tomorrow comes
We got to work, work
Work it out
We got to work, work

Work it out

She made her point
Building up the courage just to raise her voice
Heading towards a consequence
For every bit of ignorance, incompetence
It's time for us to work it out

We got to work, work it out


Wrong Again
Father I hate to tell you this
You taught me how to hit the mark
And once again I missed.
Touch the fire
You always said that I get burned
Why is it so hard to remember?
All the lessons I have learned.

How could you look at me that way?
When I have failed so many times
Showing me love you tell the world
This child is mine
How could you walk that extra mile?
I see forgiveness in your smile
So should you reject me?
Wrong again

Once again
Lord I have wondered from a path
Thought I knew a better way
From a shorter word you've asked
Standing here
I don't deserve a second chance
And I can't conceal the shame of you
Then more I can stand

How could you look at me that way?
When I have failed so many times
Showing me love you tell the world
This child is mine
How could you walk that extra mile?
I see forgiveness in your smile
So should you reject me?
Wrong again

When I look into your face
And see the power of your grace
I find it so hard to believe
Forgiveness that you're showing me
I see the answer in your eyes
Love and mercy realized
Finally the truth has set me free

How could you look at me that way?
When I have failed so many times
Showing me love you tell the world
This child is mine
How could you walk that extra mile?
I see forgiveness in your smile
So should you reject me?
Wrong again

I thought you was going
Instead you're just holy
Thought you would judge me
Instead you just love me
So should you reject me?
Wrong again


One day when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a flux capacitor

He told me, he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah, he said

"I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine"

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands and another one, and another one
And another one
And girls there with round hair like star wars
And float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah, he said

"I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine"

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album, seventh album

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah

Been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, doing fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine"

Got the news today
But they said I had to stay
A little bit longer and I'd be fine
When I thought it'd all be done 
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine.
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile or laugh you glow
You don't even know, know, know.
You don't even know.

All this time moves by
Still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine.
Waiting' on a cure
But none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
You don't know what its like to feel so low.
And every time you smile or laugh you glow
You don't even know, know, know.
You don't even know, know, know.
You don't even know, no.

And you don't know what you got 'til it's gone.
Don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah!
And every time you smile or laugh you glow,
You don't even know! yeah! whoa!

So I'll wait 'til kingdom come.
All the highs and lows are gone.
A little bit longer and I'll be fine.
I'll be...fine

Everybody's in that groove. Tell the D.J. to play my song. Are you ready to rock and roll? You gotta live to party bust your move. Everybody's in that groove. Tell the D.J. to play my song. Are you ready to rock and roll? Hey, Hey, Hey!


'''Max:'''
Praying won't do it,
Hating won't do it,
Drinking won't do it,
Fighting won't knock you out,
Of my head.

'''Tom:'''
Hiding won't hide it,
Smiling won't hide it,
Like I ain't tried it,
Everyone's tried it now,
And failed somehow.

'''Jay:'''
So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out, out?

'''Nathan and Siva:'''
And if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, 
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know,
How do you get out, get out?

'''Tom and Siva:'''
Cause drivin' won't do it,
Flyin' won't do it,
Denyin' won't do it,
Crying won't drown it out,
What you said.

'''Jay and Siva:'''
When I'm standin' on the yellow line,
Waitin' at the station,
Or I'm late for work,
A vital presentation,
If you call me now girl,
Without reservation,
I will try to break through.

'''All:'''
But if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only I never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?

'''Max:'''
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?

A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can't you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low

'''All:'''
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

'''Max:'''
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low.

I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
Till it ceases I'll never know, 
How do you get you get up from an all time low.


'''Max:'''
Woah, oh
I hear your heart cry for love,
But you won't let me make it right.
You were hurt, but I decided,
That you were worth the fight.

Every night, you lock up,
You won't let me come inside.
But the look in your eyes,
Say I can turn the tide.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I can tell you can fit one more.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I don't care who was there before.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.

'''Tom:'''
This ain't the Heartbreak Hotel,
Even though I know it well.
Those no shows, they sure tell,
In the way you hold yourself.

'''Tom and Jay:'''
Don't you fret, should you get,
Another cancellation.
Give me a chance I'd make a,
Permanent reservation.

'''Max and Siva:'''
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
'''Max:'''
I can tell you can fit one more.
'''Max and Siva:'''
Open up make a brand new start,
'''Max:'''
I don't care who's stayed before.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.

'''Jay:'''
When I, talk to you, on the phone,
And listen close.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.


'''Tom:'''
They say that time
Heals everything 
But they don't know you 
And the scars you bring

'''Max:'''
'Cause you left a jagged hole 
And I can't stand it anymore

'''All:'''
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind

'''Nathan:'''
I'd erase my thoughts
If only I knew how

'''Max:'''
Fill my head with white noise
If it would drown you out
Kill the sound

'''All:'''
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it, I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind

'''Nathan:'''
And I'd rather be crazy
I'd rather go insane

'''Tom:'''
Than having you stalk my every thought
Then having you here inside my heart

'''All:'''
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind


'''Tom:'''
You know I never want to hurt you
Don't know why I'd ever want to, oh oh oh
There's no comfort in another face
Are you gonna let it go to waste?
Oh oh oh

'''Max:'''
I keep on trying
But how can I find it
When they don't compare to you
No oh

'''All:'''
I'm running out of patience
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder 
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations 
Running out of patience 
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart

'''Tom and Jay:'''
Must be crazy if I let you go
You were everything I need to know
Come back home

'''Tom:'''
Feels like I'm dying 
'Cause I keep on finding 
'''Tom and Max:'''
Every junction leads to here 
And I'm lost

'''All:'''
I'm running out of patience 
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder 
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations 
Running out of patience 
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart

'''Max and Siva:'''
Everywhere I turn
Is the wrong direction
Everyone I see is the wrong reflection
Reminding me that I just
Can't replace your heart

'''All:'''
I'm running out of patience 
Tired of imitations 
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to 
Is just another not you 
Makes me wonder 
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations 
Running out of patience 
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart

'''Nathan:'''
I've been through the crowds 
Called your name out loud 
But there's still no way to replace you
'''Nathan and Tom:'''
I've looked everywhere 
Everywhere everywhere 
To replace your heart
'''Max:'''
To replace your heart


'''Jay:'''
I'm gonna see some friends from outta state
The very trip that you were supposed to take a while ago
But it fell through
Like all of you
Like all of you

Thought I'd make the drive 
But a free plane ride is in the air
Just like that my fear of it disappeared 
Like all of you
Like all of you

And I looked high and low 
For yesterday 
High and low for you and I 
High and low

Once I can see straight 
I might move somewhere cold
Seattle or the Bay area
To see your ghost
What's left of you 
What's left of you

And I looked high and low 
For yesterday 
High and low 
For you and I 
High and low

Found a letter from a man.
A modern man
Addressed to you
And now I steal the words he ended with
I miss you
And I do
Miss you
And I do

High and low 
For yesterday 
High and low 
For you and I 
High and low


'''Max:'''
Now this melody’s a healer 
It’s got my baby in a fever 
And I hope it gets the better of you 
With this Morricone music 
There’s no way you can refute it 
But girl you ain’t got nothing to lose

'''Tom:'''
Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh 
It’s not who you know 
When I’m what you know 
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me 
Aye aye aye, girl gone gone gone 
Don’t want a room full of snakes 
If the lights are on and 
Aye aye aye 
Just come and go with me

'''All:'''
Will the angel or the devil,
Die in ecstasy?
There’s something coming over you 
Come over me 
Falling in love is never easy 
'Cause they’re so good
I’m so bad, so let’s get ugly

'''Max:'''
Now she’s a gentle mental 
Got perversions detrimental 
But there’s times 
I just don’t know what to do. 
She’s all grown up and sexy 
And I know she’s not my baby 
But man, I ain’t got nothing to lose

'''Tom:'''
Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh 
It’s not who you know 
When I’m what you know 
Aye aye aye

Aye aye aye, girl gone gone gone 
Don’t want a room full of snakes

Aye aye aye, 
Just come and go with me

Will the angel or the devil 
Die in ecstasy?
There’s something coming over you 
Come over me 
Falling in love is never easy 
‘Cause they’re so good

'''Jay:'''
I see you walk away walk away 
So why you looking back at me like that, like that?
If you're not messing with, messing with me
Then why you go on and kiss me like that, like that?
My head is killing me, killing me girl 
Are you telling me stay or go?

'''All:'''
If I can't have you 
Why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me 
Say it on the radio 
So go on, go on, go on, just play it 
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me 
‘Cause you can't let me go, me go

'''Max:'''
Monday and you're all over me 
Now it's Friday and you're MIA 
And if you're letting go, letting go, me
Then why you go on and hold me that way, that way?
The chase is killing me killing me girl 
Now I'm telling you stay or go

'''All:'''
If I can't have you 
Why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me 
Say it on the radio

'''Tom:'''
Now I've gone and said it all 
Now I'm here out in the open 
Don't say another time,
Another place, another face

'''All:'''
If I can't have you 
Why won't you let me go? 
If you don't want me

‘Cause you can't let me go, me go
‘Cause you can't let me go 
So go on, go on, go on
Say it on the radio


'''Max:'''
Don’t live in black and white, do we?
It’s just another fight to me 
If we don’t take it on we won’t get far

It seems so far away but so close 
It’s there for us to take when most 
Would waste it, don’t waste it

'''All:'''
And we try and we fall 
And we live another day 
And we rise like a phoenix 
From the flames 
And it burns but it turns out golden

'''Jay:'''
We loved to dream aloud 
With both feet on the ground 
But where’s the sense in that?
We’d never get it back 
We’d be wasted 
'''Nathan:'''
We’d be wasted

'''All:'''
And we try and we fall 
And we live another day 
And we rise like a phoenix 
From the flames 
And it burns but it turns out golden 
And went for the sky 
And we fell down low 
And flew too high 
But we still survived 'cause you and I 
We turned out Golden

'''Tom:'''
They tore it to pieces 
We’ll build it again 
'''Siva:'''
Ah ah ah ah 
Ah ah ah ah

'''All:'''
And we try and we fall 
And we live another day 
And we rise like a phoenix 
From the flames 
And it burns but it turns out golden 
And went for the sky 
And fell down low 
And flew too high 
But we still survived 'cause you and I 
We turned out Golden


'''Max:'''
She aims a smile with the safety off
And she's not afraid to use it
She holds my gaze just long enough
For me to feel like I'm gonna lose it

'''Tom:'''
And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she calls
I'll fall for her every time

'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around 
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
'''All:'''
She is my weakness
She is my weakness

'''Jay:'''
A look from her is like oxygen
How would I keep breathing  without her
She breaks a whole as she looks away 
Now my heart ain't beating without her

'''Nathan:'''
And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she goes 
I'll come for her every time

'''Max:'''
'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around 
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
'''All:'''
She is my weakness
She is my weakness

'''Jay:'''
I know it might sound crazy 
But I don't wanna let go
Now I don't mind spending every night if you don't let go

I know it might sound crazy 
But I don't wanna let go
Now I don't mind spending every night if you don't let go

'''All:'''
'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around 
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
She is my weakness
She is my weakness


'''All:'''
Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left

'''Nathan:'''
Tell me what's going on
I know there's something on your mind
Can you just open up? 
Do you feel like out of love?, 
Is somebody trying to hurt you?
Know I'd never let that happen, 
Must be out of their minds

'''Tom and Max:'''
'Cause you are the sunshine that makes my day
And I won't let them take that away,

'''All:'''
I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fights
And if your battles are pilling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier

Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left

'''Siva:'''
If life is a battlefield, 
And there's so many dangers
Just when you think its okay, 
It blows up in your face
And when this road gets harder
You think your lucks ran out
I will find a reserve 

'''Jay and Max:'''
To take it right back
To where your heart deserves
'Cause there is no way that I won't put you first

'''All:'''
I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fights
And if your battles are piling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier

Left, left, left, right, left.


'''Tom:'''
I feel something over me
And try to run away from the demons that haunted me

'''Max:'''
The key turns inside
No place to hide
I'm locked in no place,
'''Jay:'''
No place

'''All:'''
I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
Feeling the walls come closer, bodies colder oh
'Cause I'm behind bars
'Cause I'm behind bars

'''Tom:'''
Now a whisper's calling me
And why does my skin crawl
With the pain of insanity?

'''Max:'''
The key turns inside
No place to hide
I'm locked in no place, no place

'''All:'''
I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
Feeling the walls come closer, bodies colder oh
'Cause I'm behind bars
'Cause I'm behind bars

Let me out of here
I need somebody please

'''All:'''
I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
Feeling the walls come closer bodies colder oh
'Cause I'm behind bars
'Cause I'm behind bars
'''Nathan:'''
Behind bars


'''Tom:'''
You could hurt with the words, 
You could change my life, 
You could tell me the truth, 
It would cut like a knife but I won't let go
But I won't let go, but I won't let go

'''Max:'''
You could fall, hit the wall
You could lose your way
You could lose, you could bruise,
Spend it all in day but I won't let go
But I won't let go, but I won't let go

'''Nathan:'''
'Cause if I had to save someone, I'd still save you
And if I had to pray for someone, I'd pray for you

'''All:'''
'Cause you know we are made for each other
Can't take that away, made for each other
Like sunshine and day, made for each other, I'm here to stay
'Cause you know we are made for each other
I'm made for you, made for each other
Like stars and the moon, made for each other
We'll see it through 
'Cause you know we are made

'''Tom:'''
They could take, they could hate
They could break our hearts
They could try all they want, 
Never tear us apart, we will not let go, 
We will not let go, we will not let go

'''Nathan:'''
'Cause if I had to save someone, I'd still save you
And if I had to pray for someone, I'd pray for you

'''Siva:'''
'Cause you know we are made...


'''Jay:'''
Seen the change, watching it fade
Holding my breath feeling it fail
Working hard wondering why
Can't fix it now, so why even try?

'''All:'''
We've run out of time
It's over, I'm over this life, I'm running dry
I'm out of here, out of your life
It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time to break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die

'''Tom:'''
Not easy to say harder to do
But that's no kinda life, so I'll leave it to you
Working it hard wondering why
Can't fix it now, so why even try?

'''All:'''
We've run out of time
It's over I'm over this life, I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life
It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time to break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die

'''Tom and Jay:'''
There's not a chance, there's not a prayer
Can't pull a miracle out of the air
So now I'm leaving,
Letting it lie, letting it die

'''All:'''
We've run out of time
It's over I'm over this life, I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life
It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time to break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love, for love to die

'''Nathan:'''
For love to die, 
'''All:'''
For love to die
For love to die, 
For love to die

'''Max:'''
It's a good day for love for love to die, for love to die


'''Tom:'''
Yeah I'm not dead 
I'm alive, I survived
While falling apart at the seams
Yeah I have grown 
I'm alone, I have flown
To the far away land of my dreams

Give me a little chance
To show you what I've learned
I will explain the circumstance
In which I have returned

'''All:'''
'Cause I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I don't wanna break you
Force or complicate you
That is the way that I feel

'''Siva:'''
Yeah it was fate to wait, hesitate
Finding some time on our own
They won't believe
That the joy that we need
Was so very far from our home

'''Tom:'''
Give me a little chance
To show you what I've learned
I will explain the circumstance
In which I have returned

'''All:'''
'Cause I can’t forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I try to accept you
Love and protect you
That is the way that I feel

'''Tom:'''
We will go on
Like the moon and the sun
Revolving around the earth

'''All:'''
'Cause I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I try to accept you
Love and protect you
That is the way that I feel


'''Max:'''
Praying won't do it,
Hating won't do it,
Drinking won't do it,
Fighting won't knock you out,
Of my head.

'''Tom:'''
Hiding won't hide it,
Smiling won't hide it,
Like I ain't tried it,
Everyone's tried it now,
And failed somehow.

'''Jay:'''
So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out, out?

'''Nathan and Siva:'''
And if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, 
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know,
How do you get out, get out?

'''Tom and Siva:'''
Cause drivin' won't do it,
Flyin' won't do it,
Denyin' won't do it,
Crying won't drown it out,
What you said.

'''Jay and Siva:'''
When I'm standin' on the yellow line,
Waitin' at the station,
Or I'm late for work,
A vital presentation,
If you call me now girl,
Without reservation,
I will try to break through.

'''All:'''
But if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only I never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?

'''Max:'''
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?

A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can't you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low

'''All:'''
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

'''Max:'''
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low.

I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
Till it ceases I'll never know, 
How do you get you get up from an all time low.


'''Max:'''
Woah, oh
I hear your heart cry for love,
But you won't let me make it right.
You were hurt, but I decided,
That you were worth the fight.

Every night, you lock up,
You won't let me come inside.
But the look in your eyes,
Say I can turn the tide.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I can tell you can fit one more.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I don't care who was there before.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.

'''Tom:'''
This ain't the Heartbreak Hotel,
Even though I know it well.
Those no shows, they sure tell,
In the way you hold yourself.

'''Tom and Jay:'''
Don't you fret, should you get,
Another cancellation.
Give me a chance I'd make a,
Permanent reservation.

'''Max and Siva:'''
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
'''Max:'''
I can tell you can fit one more.
'''Max and Siva:'''
Open up make a brand new start,
'''Max:'''
I don't care who's stayed before.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.

'''Jay:'''
When I, talk to you, on the phone,
And listen close.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.


'''Max:'''
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came

'''Nathan:'''
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see you and me

'''Tom:'''
Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

'''All:'''
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, 
'''Jay:'''
I'm glad you came

'''Siva:'''
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see you and me

'''Nathan:'''
Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

'''All:'''
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, 
'''Jay:'''

I'm glad you came
So glad you came
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came

'''Max:'''
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came


'''Tom:'''
You're in control
Pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air
So I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though
My time has come

'''Jay:'''
How many times do I fly
Through your head space?
Now we're speeding away
From a safe place
Yeah your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

'''All:'''
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning

We touch like
Like it's our first time, oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh

'''Siva:'''
Just you and me and the
Goats in the back room
Learning things they don't
Teach in classroom
Now, your here
And feel the fear
But everything is all so clear

'''Nathan:'''
I've been addicted to you
Since it first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric
Yeah, your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

'''All:'''
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know, that it's a little bit frightening
We might aswell be playing
With lightning

We touch like
Like it's our first time , oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

'''Nathan:'''
Your skin, your touch
The kiss, too much
'''Tom:'''
Your skin, your touch
To kiss, the rush
'''Jay:'''
Your skin, your touch
To kiss, too much
'''Max:'''
The rush, the rush
The rush, the rush

'''All:'''
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know, that it's a little bit frightening
We might aswell be playing with lightning

We touch like,
Like it's our first time oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh


'''Nathan:'''
I can't believe I had to see
The girl of my dreams cheating on me
The pain you caused has left me dead inside
I'm gonna make sure you regret that night

I feel you close, I feel you breathe
And now it's like you're here
You're haunting me
You're out of line
You're out of sight
You're the reason that we started this fight

'''All:'''
But I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone

'''Jay:'''
In our house, I hate that place
Everywhere I walk I see your face
Try to erase a memory with a flame
And hope I'll never see you again
Standing here in this burning room
You know the end could never come so soon
'''Nathan:'''
It's clear to me the lies you used
The ones that kill me ain't hurting you

'''All:'''
So I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone

'''Max:'''
I'm running from a warzone
I can't do this anymore
I'm running from a warzone
What are we fighting for?

I'm running from a warzone

'''All:'''
I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone


'''Max:'''
Tonight could be forgettable
Cause I'm drinking all the alcohol
Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cool

'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Tonight I feel invincible

'''Nathan:'''
Tonight I feel invincible
Just please don't tell the principal
The feeling's irresistible
In detention getting physical

'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Tonight I feel invincible

'''Jay:'''
Tonight I feel unstoppable
And anything is possible
'Cause we are uncontrollable
And we don't do predictable

'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
'''Nathan:'''
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
'Cause I like it like that

'''Siva:'''
Tonight could be forgettable
Cause I'm drinking all the alcohol
Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cool

'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Tonight I feel invincible


'''Jay:'''
Words travel fast,
So you spend all your time in your head,
What’s the point in that?
'Cause words never last,
What you say now is not what you said.
And I’m okay with that.

'''Tom:'''
You’re keeping yourself tied up,
So you won’t let me down
Didn't you ever think, just maybe

'''All:'''
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
'''Max:'''
Don’t let me be the last to know, yeah
Don’t let me be the last to know

'''Nathan:'''
You take all I have,
Still I pour you a half-empty glass,
What’s the point in that?
And all I ever ask
Is that you tell me when it's is not enough,
'Cause if it’s real love

'''All:'''
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
'''Max:'''
Don’t let me be the last to know

'''Nathan:'''
And maybe you’ll find what you really wanted
'Cause what you left behind and all your dreams are haunted
Maybe I’ll move on, or maybe I’ll just stay
Either way…

'''Jay:'''
I hope you’ll understand me
If I say we can’t be
So if you wanna go
I want you to know

'''All:'''
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
'''Max:'''
Don’t let me be the last to know, yeah
Don’t let me be the last to know
Don’t let me be the last to know


'''Jay:'''
This is not gonna last forever
It’s a time where you must hold on.
And I won’t let you surrender,
And I’ll heal you if you’re broken.

'''Nathan:'''
We can stand so tall together.
We can make it through the stormy weather.
We can go through it all together, 
Do it all together, do it all.

I’ll be your strength.
I will, I will, I will.
I’ll be your strength.
Yes I will, yes I will.

'''Tom:'''
I won’t sleep 'til the sky is calmer,
Keep on searching 'til I find you.
And my love will be your armour,
In this battlefield around you.

'''Nathan:'''
Hand in hand we walk together,
We can make it through the stormy weather.
We can break down walls together, 
Do it all together, do it all.

I’ll be your strength.
I will, I will, I will.
I’ll be your strength.
Yes I will, yes I will.

'''All:'''
Hold on, hold on.
I’ll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I’ll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I’ll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I’ll be, there...

'''Nathan:'''
I’ll be your strength.
I will, I will be.
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be, I’ll be
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be, I’ll be
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be, I’ll be

'''Max:'''
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be strong for you
I’ll be your strength.
And I’ll keep strong for you.


'''Nathan:'''
You think you've seen me
You haven't seen nothing
I'm looking for something more than this
I'm feeling no limits
I'm seizing each minute
Don't wanna,
Don't wanna just exist

Don't want my feet on the ground
Wanna feel the speed of sound
I want it now
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky

Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high

'''Tom:'''
I'm climbing, I'm rising
I'm striking like lightning
Write my name in skywriting
For all to see
I'll do something epic
And they won't forget it
Good enough's not good enough for me

'''Max:'''
I want the ride of my life
Want to reach the speed of light
Want it tonight
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky

Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high

'''Jay:'''
Never gonna make my way down
I'll make the galaxy my playground
'''Siva:'''
It's gonna be one hell of a ride
I'll fly

'''Nathan:'''
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high


'''Siva:'''
Take a moment, listen please
Words like these don't come with ease
You took my heart and kept it low
Now it's time to let it go

'''Max:'''
I want it all or nothing at all, to have you here
Some people fall to hold on to their tears
And if you want it all, I'd do anything to see you through
And if I fall my heart holds on to you

'''Siva:'''
Just one look and I'll subside
When I'm with you my love can't hide
Take a chance, don't run away
With every breath I need to say

'''Max:'''
I want it all or nothing at all, to have you here
Some people fall to hold on to their tears
And if you want it all, I'll do anything to see this through
And if I fall my heart holds on to you


'''Nathan:'''
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.

'''Tom:'''
Come here right now girl,
I’ll make you sweat like you've worked out,
Then we’ll down a drink or two,
You won’t know what I’ll put you through.

'''All:'''
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.

'''Nathan:'''
Let’s get down and some more.
Then we’ll take it to the floor.
So make your body close to mine,
Girl you’re looking fine.
Now for the last time...

'''All:'''
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.

'''Jay:'''
Come here right now girl,
I’ll make you sweat like you've worked out,
Then we’ll down a drink or two,
You won’t know what I’ll put you through.

'''All:'''
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.

'''Tom:'''
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.



'''Jay:'''
Say it, though you're looking down and to the left, now
Say it, like someone who really means it
Do it, 'cause if you grow a conscience, now
We fall down

'''Tom:'''
Smiling, like there's nothing wrong
You're good at smiling, so keep it plastered on
Until the morning, 'cause if you shift to genuine
Then we'll fall out
And we fall down

'''All:'''
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me, to me

'''Nathan:'''
So kiss me and tell me I'm the one
There's no other, no other one you want
Baby, kiss me, make sure you close your eyes
Or we fall down
Yes, we fall down

'''All:'''
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me, to me

'''Nathan:'''
Now I can see, you bite your lip when you look at me
One word, you say, and everything is giving you away
Let's close our eyes and save the truth for one more night
Or I fall down
Or I fall down

'''Siva:'''
Don't say it's all for the better
I need you to lie, to lie to me
'''All:'''
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me

Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me, to me

Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me


'''Tom:'''
Say my name like it's the last time,
Live today like it's your last night,
'''Max:'''
We want to cry, but we know its alright,
Cause I'm with you and you're with me,

'''Nathan:'''
Butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
We could rule the world someday, somehow 
But we'll never be as bright as we are now.

'''Max:'''
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.

'''Siva:'''
Promise me you'll stay the way you are,
Keep the fire alive and stay young at heart,
'''Nathan:'''
When the storm feels like it could blow you out
Remember, you got me and I got you
'Cause we are..

'''Jay:'''
Butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
When the innocence is dead and gone
These will be the times we look back on

'''Max:'''
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.

'''Tom:'''
I won't, I won't let your memory go 
'Cause your colours they burn so bright,
Who knows, who knows what tomorrow will hold 
But I know that we'll be alright

'Cause we're butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
We could rule the world someday, somehow 
But we'll never be as bright as we are now.

'''Max:'''
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.


'''Siva:'''
Stay, won't beg you to stay
Go, yeah, I'll be okay
Won't kill me this way, oh, oh
At least that's what I'll say

'''Nathan:'''
No, you don't have to know
The wounds that hurt me the most
'Cause I'll never show
Just how deep they go

'''Max:'''
That's why I'm telling you
'''All:'''
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger, dagger
Dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger,
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
'''Max:'''
It's like a dagger in my heart

'''Siva:'''
Strong, I thought I was strong
These scars will heal before long
I guess I was wrong, oh, Oh
And I'm too far gone

'''Nathan:'''
Try, I know I should try
To just get on with my life
But it's slipping away tonight
There's some loves you can't survive

'''Max:'''
That's why I'm telling you
'''All:'''
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
'''Max:'''
It's like a dagger in my heart

'''Siva:'''
The last words I would say
'''Nathan:'''
Is there ain't anyone else
'''Siva:'''
Can take this pain away
'''Nathan:'''
That's why I'm telling you!

'''All:'''
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger

Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart


'''Nathan:'''
Breathe a sigh and push tonight
Open your eyes and let the light
Take you away, forget the day
The hit makes you fizz something you gotta say

'''Tom:'''
And I can still see the old days in your face
We have grown and we own it all

'''Max:'''
This is a rave, not a grave
Everyone head to the light
'Cause we are not, not afraid
Of pushing the limit tonight

'''All:'''
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
Oh, oh, oh

'''Jay:'''
Take a risk and feel the rush
It's just begun a change in us
Open your mind, your mind, your mind
And don't you be worried about what you find

And I can still see the old days in your face
'''Tom:'''
We have grown and we own it all

'''Max:'''
This is a rave, not a grave
Everyone head to the light
Cause we are not, not afraid
Of pushing the limit tonight

'''All:'''
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh

'''Nathan:'''
This is a rave, not a grave
This is a rave, not a grave
We are not, not afraid

'''All:'''
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight

We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping
The dead won't be sleeping tonight.


'''Jay:'''
Stop, look, listen what I’m saying
Don’t push, haven’t got to chase it
Just me, I don’t have to fake it
Never gonna change it, I don’t have to fake it

'''Tom:'''
Back off, back off, you won't get very far
Back off, back off I think you think you’re a star
Back off, back off, I don’t know who you are
I think you think you’re a star, you’re a star!

'''Max:'''
There’s something bad in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’d like it out of my mind so,
I can’t hear a thing
I'm about to tell you what I mean

'''Siva:'''
Fast cars, smooth talk, Flash watch ('''Jay:''' turn it off!)
Fake hair, fake tan, Lip gloss ('''Jay:''' turn it off)
Hot shot, who cares?
Cause I just don’t give a damn
'''Jay:'''
Turn it off, off!

'''Jay:'''
Time moves, seems like nothing's changing
VIP isn't that amazing
So seen, but it doesn't faze me
Never gonna change me, no it doesn't faze me

'''Tom:'''
Back off, back off, you won't get very far
Back off, back off I think you think you’re a star
Back off, back off, I don’t know who you are
I think you think you’re a star, you’re a star!

'''Max:'''
There’s something bad in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’d like it out of my mind so
I can’t hear a thing
I'm about to tell you what I mean
Turn it off, off, I turn it off!

'''Siva:'''
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong

Being down not out
Being lost not found
No words, no sound
On this lonely track
The wind can roll,
The storm can rage
It's all the same
I'm not turning back

Over night things can change, always
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Dusty tracks kicking on and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong

No chains to break
No walls to climb
Just space and time waiting for me
No cares, no fares,
No shame, no pride
Just stars to guide where I need to be

Over night things can change, always

I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
dusty tracks kicking off and on
not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Where I belong
Where I belong

I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Dusty tracks kicking on and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong

I'm on my own (where I belong)
And the road is long (where I belong)
I'll do what it takes (where I belong)
Just finding a place (where I belong)
Dusty tracks (where I belong) kicking on and on (where I belong)
Not a coin to my name (where I belong)
Just finding a place
Where I belong

The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see you and me

'''Tom:'''
Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can

Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay

Make you glad you came

We're together now

We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

Till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming?
And we'll never grow old again
'''Tom:'''
You'll find us chasing the sun

'''Max:'''
Praying won't do it,
Hating won't do it,
Drinking won't do it,
Fighting won't knock you out,
Of my head.

'''Tom:'''
Hiding won't hide it,
Smiling won't hide it,
Like I ain't tried it,
Everyone's tried it now,
And failed somehow.

'''Jay:'''
So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out, out?

'''Nathan and Siva:'''
And if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, 
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know,
How do you get out, get out?

'''Tom and Siva:'''
Cause drivin' won't do it,
Flyin' won't do it,
Denyin' won't do it,
Crying won't drown it out,
What you said.

'''Jay and Siva:'''
When I'm standin' on the yellow line,
Waitin' at the station,
Or I'm late for work,
A vital presentation,
If you call me now girl,
Without reservation,
I will try to break through.

'''All:'''
But if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only I never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?

'''Max:'''
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?

A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can't you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low

'''All:'''
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

'''Max:'''
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low.

I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
Till it ceases I'll never know, 
How do you get you get up from an all time low.


'''Nathan:'''
Baby come over here
I just gotta tell you something, something
There’s nothing left to fear
There’s nothing that can hurt you, nothing

We could take on the bodies of angels 
Away from everyone 
Touch as we circle the world 
You and me, on the run

'''Max:'''
So put your hands up to the sky
Yeah put ‘em up
Follow me, if you wanna fly 
I’ll show you love
Put your hands up to the sky, inside of mine 
When we touch, we get so high

'''All:'''
Like a satellite
'''Max:'''
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love now
'''All:'''
Like a satellite
'''Max:'''
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love

Look at the stars above
We’re the only thing that’s brighter, brighter
Tonight you can feel the love
The way I feel around you, lighter

Away from everyone

'''Tom:'''
You're in control
Pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air
So I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though
My time has come

'''Jay:'''
How many times do I fly
Through your head space?
Now we're speeding away
From a safe place
Yeah your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

'''All:'''
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning

We touch like
Like it's our first time, oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh

'''Siva:'''
Just you and me and the
Goats in the back room
Learning things they don't
Teach in classroom
Now, your here
And feel the fear
But everything is all so clear

'''Nathan:'''
I've been addicted to you
Since it first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric
Yeah, your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

'''All:'''
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know, that it's a little bit frightening
We might aswell be playing
With lightning

We touch like
Like it's our first time , oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

'''Nathan:'''
Your skin, your touch
The kiss, too much
'''Tom:'''
Your skin, your touch
To kiss, the rush
'''Jay:'''
Your skin, your touch
To kiss, too much
'''Max:'''
The rush, the rush
The rush, the rush

'''All:'''
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know, that it's a little bit frightening
We might aswell be playing with lightning

We touch like,
Like it's our first time oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh


'''Max:'''
Woah, oh
I hear your heart cry for love,
But you won't let me make it right.
You were hurt, but I decided,
That you were worth the fight.

Every night, you lock up,
You won't let me come inside.
But the look in your eyes,
Say I can turn the tide.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I can tell you can fit one more.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I don't care who was there before.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.

'''Tom:'''
This ain't the Heartbreak Hotel,
Even though I know it well.
Those no shows, they sure tell,
In the way you hold yourself.

'''Tom and Jay:'''
Don't you fret, should you get,
Another cancellation.
Give me a chance I'd make a,
Permanent reservation.

'''Max and Siva:'''
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
'''Max:'''
I can tell you can fit one more.
'''Max and Siva:'''
Open up make a brand new start,
'''Max:'''
I don't care who's stayed before.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.

'''Jay:'''
When I, talk to you, on the phone,
And listen close.

'''All:'''
I hear your heart cry for love,
Then you act like there's no room.
Room for me, or anyone,
"Don't disturb" is all I see.

Close the door, turn the key,
On everything that we could be.
If loneliness would move out,
I'd fill the vacancy.

In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart.


'''Tom:'''
Say my name like it's the last time,
Live today like it's your last night,
'''Max:'''
We want to cry, but we know its alright,
Cause I'm with you and you're with me,

'''Nathan:'''
Butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
We could rule the world someday, somehow 
But we'll never be as bright as we are now.

'''Max:'''
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.

'''Siva:'''
Promise me you'll stay the way you are,
Keep the fire alive and stay young at heart,
'''Nathan:'''
When the storm feels like it could blow you out
Remember, you got me and I got you
'Cause we are..

'''Jay:'''
Butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
When the innocence is dead and gone
These will be the times we look back on

'''Max:'''
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.

'''Tom:'''
I won't, I won't let your memory go 
'Cause your colours they burn so bright,
Who knows, who knows what tomorrow will hold 
But I know that we'll be alright

'Cause we're butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
We could rule the world someday, somehow 
But we'll never be as bright as we are now.

'''Max:'''
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.


'''Tom:'''
They say that time
Heals everything 
But they don't know you 
And the scars you bring

'''Max:'''
'Cause you left a jagged hole 
And I can't stand it anymore

'''All:'''
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind

'''Nathan:'''
I'd erase my thoughts
If only I knew how

'''Max:'''
Fill my head with white noise
If it would drown you out
Kill the sound

'''All:'''
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it, I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind

'''Nathan:'''
And I'd rather be crazy
I'd rather go insane

'''Tom:'''
Than having you stalk my every thought
Then having you here inside my heart

'''All:'''
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it I can't take it

I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind


'''Nathan:'''
I can't believe I had to see
The girl of my dreams cheating on me
The pain you caused has left me dead inside
I'm gonna make sure you regret that night

I feel you close, I feel you breathe
And now it's like you're here
You're haunting me
You're out of line
You're out of sight
You're the reason that we started this fight

'''All:'''
But I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone

'''Jay:'''
In our house, I hate that place
Everywhere I walk I see your face
Try to erase a memory with a flame
And hope I'll never see you again
Standing here in this burning room
You know the end could never come so soon
'''Nathan:'''
It's clear to me the lies you used
The ones that kill me ain't hurting you

'''All:'''
So I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone

'''Max:'''
I'm running from a warzone
I can't do this anymore
I'm running from a warzone
What are we fighting for?

I'm running from a warzone

'''All:'''
I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone


'''Nathan:'''
You think you've seen me
You haven't seen nothing
I'm looking for something more than this
I'm feeling no limits
I'm seizing each minute
Don't wanna,
Don't wanna just exist

Don't want my feet on the ground
Wanna feel the speed of sound
I want it now
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky

Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high

'''Tom:'''
I'm climbing, I'm rising
I'm striking like lightning
Write my name in skywriting
For all to see
I'll do something epic
And they won't forget it
Good enough's not good enough for me

'''Max:'''
I want the ride of my life
Want to reach the speed of light
Want it tonight
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky

Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high

'''Jay:'''
Never gonna make my way down
I'll make the galaxy my playground
'''Siva:'''
It's gonna be one hell of a ride
I'll fly

'''Nathan:'''
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high


'''Max:'''
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

'''All:'''
La la la la la
La la la la la

'''Max:'''
When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say

'''Tom:'''
This man was a legend, a legend of his time
When he was at a party, the party never died

'''Nathan:'''
Hey, everybody's got a dream so what do you say
Are we making history?

'''All:'''
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La la la la la
La la la la la

'''Jay:'''
For tonight I'm famous, for tonight I'm king
And I will be remembered for centuries, they'll say

'''Tom:'''
This man was a hero, a hero of the night
When he was at a party, the party never died

'''Nathan:'''
Hey, I'm a little drunk, but I got something to say

'''All:'''
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night

And let us wake up inside of stranger's bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night, my friends, we will not forget
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

'''Siva:'''
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
'''Max:'''
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night


'''Max:'''
When I was young
I read stories where princes won
As I grew up
I thought the stories were wrong

But to you, girl
I am faithful
I've fallen so hard that it’s painful
When it hurts I know the feeling's are real

'''Tom:'''
I'll let nothing in the middle
Nothing in the middle
Of me and you, me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

'''Max:'''
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle
In the middle of us

'''Nathan:'''
I don't know
How the story of us unfolds
Or if when we're old
We'll still be together at all

'''Jay:'''
But to you, girl
I am faithful
I've fallen so hard that it's painful
And when it hurts, I know the feelings are real

'''Max:'''
I'll let nothing in the middle
Nothing in the middle
Of me and you, me and you
Oh, nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

'''Tom:'''
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle
In the middle of us

'''Jay:'''
When I feel you breathe
In my arms at night
When I feel you breathe
As I hold you tight

I believe
We are meant to be
Meant to be
'''Max:'''
We are meant to be

'''Max:'''
When I was young
I read stories where princes won
As I grew up
I thought the stories were wrong

I'll let nothing in the middle
Nothing in the middle
Of me and you, me and you
Oh, nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle
In the middle of us
In the middle of us


'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons

'''Nathan:'''
Shut it out, what you heard about
What you heard about me
They say I'm rough or loud, but they
Don't know nothing, not a thing about me

'''Max:'''
So tear up that list of things
You wrote down, wrote down
Why you can never be
With me now, not now

'''Nathan:'''
I know where you wanna be

'''Tom:'''
You wanna say
No, no, it ain't gonna work
But then you fumble your words
'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons
'''Nathan:'''
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons

'''Max:'''
Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
'''Tom:'''
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons

'''Max:'''
Stand right there, you'll never get nowhere
When you run like you do, like you do
It's no, no fair, I'm sure that you're secret's out
Everyone sees right through you

'''Jay:'''
So tear up that list of things
You wrote down, wrote down
Why you can never be
With me now, not now

'''Max:'''
I know where you wanna be, yeah

'''Tom:'''
You wanna say
No, no, it ain't gonna work
But then you fumble your words
'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons
'''Nathan:'''
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons

'''Max:'''
Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
'''Tom:'''
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons

'''Jay:'''
Never was, never was a bad time to
'''Nathan:'''
Love somebody, so love me baby, yeah
'''Siva:'''
Never was, never was a better
Feeling than just saying yeah, yeah

'''Nathan:'''
Woah, oh

'''Tom:'''
You wanna say
No, no, it ain't gonna work
But then you fumble your words
'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons
'''Nathan:'''
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
'''All:'''
Oh, you're running out of reasons

'''Max:'''
Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
'''Tom:'''
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons


'''Nathan:'''
She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves us where the room around the lights turn like the sky
Confidence like a rock star

'''Max:'''
I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight, tonight

'''All:'''
I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, when the music played
I was lost 'til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

'''Tom:'''
The night is getting older
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end

'''Siva:'''
I know she feels the same
'Cause I can see it in her eyes
She says, "Can we start again?"

'''Max:'''
I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight

'''Nathan:'''
She's moving to the beat of my heart
We were so lost until tonight, tonight

'''All:'''
I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, when the music played
I was lost 'til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

'''Nathan:'''
I said, people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We run blinded by the light

And we all get low, all get low
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I have given up
Looking for some kind of sign

That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

'''All:'''
I found you, in my darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, when the music played
I was lost 'til I found you


'''Nathan:'''
You should've known I love you
Though I'll never say it too much
Maybe you did turn to get me
Maybe I'll never know what I done

Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
'Cause how it looks right now to me
Is you were scared of the danger

'''All:'''
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could have reached, the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
'''Nathan:'''
All you had to do was show me love

'''Jay:'''
Yeah it's true you know, we're not perfect
There's a fire inside of me
It means I'll fight for the things that are worth it
If it makes me feel complete
Cause I'm hitting rocks, and I'm taking shots
I'm prepared to lose everything I've got

'''Tom:'''
Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
Cause how it looks right now to me
That nothing can save us

'''All:'''
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could have reached, the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
'''Nathan:'''
All you had to do was show me love

'''All:'''
Show me love, love
Show me love, love ('''Nathan:''' Show me love, yeah)
Show me love, love ('''Max:''' show me, show me love)
Show me love, love ('''Max:''' show me, show me, love)
Love, love, love ('''Nathan:''' Show me love, yeah)

'''All:'''
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could have reached, the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars
For a minute I thought the world was ours
'''Nathan:'''
All you had to do was show me love
All you had to do was show me love


'''Tom:'''
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen her?
She’s the freakiest thing, you gotta meet her
You'll do whatever it takes to get her by your side

'''Max:'''
It’s not the way she smiles with a little laugh
It’s not the way she looks in a photograph
But all the boys, they crowd around

'''All:'''
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna!
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna!

'''Jay:'''
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen her?
With the way she moves you wanna kiss her
She’ll be the girl of your dreams if you can close your eyes

'''Max:'''
You can feel that beat when she’s in the room
You can feel your heart going boom boom
And all the boys, they crowd around

'''All:'''
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna!
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna!

'''Tom:'''
She walks like Rihanna!

But who cares? She walks like Rihanna!
She can’t sing, she can’t dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna!

'''Tom:'''
I might have drank too much
Electric eyes, I feel the rush
You're my drug, can't get enough
Oh oh oh oh

'''Jay:'''
I want to dance until it feels
Like time is standing still
Forget the world, just let me in, I feel so
Oh oh oh oh

'''All:'''
Having the time of my life
With you keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long

'''Max:'''
You take me off the sand
And fly me where I want to land
'''Nathan:'''
It's like this beat will never end, I feel so
Oh oh oh oh

'''All:'''
Having the time of my life
With you keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

All night long, all night long


'''Tom:'''
Yeah, we fell, we fell so hard, we sold out
Yeah, we fray and fade away, we never cut loose
There’s nobody but you
Nobody else, nobody else

Yeah, we feel, we feel all of the same things
You find, you find all of my secrets
Locked up deep inside of me
I know you're always right, always right

So save your words, I’m bleeding inside
You see the hurt, nowhere left to hide
And all this time you're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

'''Max:'''
Now I’m lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I’ll mess it up again

Now I don’t recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see us
Tearing at the seams

'''Tom:'''
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
This love is sewn

'''Max:'''
Yeah, we try, we try to leave them behind
All our mistakes, we stumble though a million fights
Every time we twist the knife
We forgive, never forget, never forget

'''Tom:'''
So save your words, I’m bleeding inside
You see the hurt, nowhere left to hide
And all this time you're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

'''Max:'''
Now I’m lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I’ll mess it up again

Now I don’t recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see us
Tearing at the seams

'''Tom:'''
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts

'''Nathan:'''
Yeah, we fell, we fell so hard, we sold out
Yeah, we fray and fade away, we never cut loose
There’s nobody but you
Nobody else

Now I’m lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing

This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn

This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
'''Tom:'''
This love is sewn


Yeah

I was on it from the get go
The way you stood out from the crowd
Still shining with the lights low
Even when the sun goes go down

When you move
My eyes are locked on you
So I'm stuck, I'm hypnotized
It's the way you shine

'Cause it's like
The strobe lights not as bright as you are
You're the only one that I can see from afar
And I follow the rays till I get to your heart
I just gotta know who you are

You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
I can see you
[Beat break]
Glow in the dark

Shocking like electro
The way you put it down
I should've came here with my shades on
'Cause I'm blinded by you now

When you move
My eyes are locked on you
So I'm stuck, I'm hypnotized
It's the way you shine

'Cause it's like
The strobe lights not as bright as you are
You're the only one that I can see from afar
And I follow the rays till I get to your heart
I just gotta know who you are

You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
I can see you
[Beat break]
Glow in the dark

Glow in the dark [x6]


'''Nathan:'''
Hey, I see a secret in your face
Did someone steal you away?
Is there someone else in my place?
I don't like this game

I, I can see the dirt on your hands
'Cause I know the way that you dance
Don't cover up cause it shows
I wish you would

'''Siva:'''
Stop right now what you doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and an ache in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh yeah, now I say

'''All:'''
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head

'''Tom:'''
You have a natural sway
And you know how sweet you taste
But I can't take your flame
Like a bullet through my veins

'''Jay:'''
As you scratch beneath my skin
My resistance's crumbling
I cover up but it shows
But I guess you know again

'''Max:'''
Stop right now what you doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and an ache in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh yeah, now I say

'''All:'''
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head

'''Nathan:'''
All this time, I said all this time
All this time
'''Max:'''
All this time
'''Nathan:'''
All this time, I said all this time
All this time
'''Max:''' 
All this time

'''All:'''
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head

All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh

All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head


'''Max:'''
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?

Stay up 'til late at night
Watch the stars burst into light
Watch movies all the time
We can't get enough

'''Jay:'''
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up

'''All:'''
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?

'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love, love, love?
'''Max:'''
Could this be love?

'''Tom:'''
Sat in bed, we're on the phone
Her voice is sweet, she doesn't know
Could stay awake all night long
Could this be love?

'''Nathan:'''
Walk together through the night
Sky is clear, the stars are bright
I kiss her lips and hold her tight
Is that enough?

'''Jay:'''
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up

'''Max:'''
Let's take a chance on this time
Could be the best of our lives
I think we already know

'''All:'''
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?

'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love, love, love?

'''Max:'''
Could this be love? ('''Nathan:''' Could this be love, love?)
Could this be love? ('''Nathan:''' Could this be love, love?)
Could this be love? ('''Nathan:''' Could this be love, love, yeah)
Could this be love?

'''Max:'''
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?

'''All:'''
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?

'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love Love, love?

'''Tom:'''
Could this be love? ('''Nathan:''' Could this be love, love?)
'''Max:'''
Could this be love? ('''Nathan:''' Could this be love, love?)
'''Tom:'''
Could this be love? ('''Nathan:''' Could this be love, love, yeah)
'''Max:'''
Could this be love?


'''Max:'''
I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
But not the kind you look to Hollywood for

'''Tom:'''
No flashing lights or autographs
In fact, people avoid me if they can
I got no fence hanging right outside of my door

'''Nathan:'''
And I hear them whispering when I pass
Saying to each other is that the man?
With a broken heart
'Cause you tore it apart

'''All:'''
And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
You're so unaware

I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows

'''Tom:'''
Everyone but you
Everyone but you

'''Nathan:'''
I got a thousand friends that follow me
Just to read about my misery
I'm popular for reasons that I hate
Yeah, yeah, and I 

'''Max:'''
Strike up the conversation
Most time a total stranger
Anyone who listens to my fate

'''Nathan:'''
But they shake their heads and they walk away
And all I'm left with is this fame
And a broken heart
'Cause you tore it apart

'''All:'''
And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even a care
You're so unaware

I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my Sid
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows

'''Nathan:'''
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you

Now if I die again would you even come?
Written on my grave will say here lies someone
With a broken heart
'Cause she tore it apart

'''All:'''
Everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even a care
You're so unaware

I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows

'''Nathan:'''
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you

'''Max:'''
I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
That all the people know
Everyone but you


'''Jay:'''
She was staring out the window
And the snow, it was falling
Seemed like everything I used to know
It was crumbling

She cannot cope and it hurts inside her mind
Couldn't let it go, let it go
Couldn't bear to ever be alone
She wondered how this had happened

'''Max:'''
He gave you up and then he let you down
All the trust is broken now
You can't remember how it used to be
Doesn't have to be a heartbreak story

Just say you'll let me in your heart
I should've been there from the start
I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be a heartbreak story

'''Tom:'''
Girl, there is no need to hide away
What's done is done now
Tangled up, you and I lay
Here together as one now

'''Nathan:'''
I'll surround you and keep you safe
Everyday, everyday
I know you never like to be alone
And now you don't have to

'''Max:'''
He gave you up and then he let you down
All the trust is broken now
You can't remember how it used to be
Doesn't have to be a heartbreak story

Just say you'll let me in your heart
I should've been there from the start
I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be a heartbreak story

'''Nathan:'''
Oh, there'll never be heartbreak story

'''Max:'''
He gave you up and then he let you down
All the trust is broken now

You can't remember how it used to be
Doesn't have to be a heartbreak story

'''Max:'''
Just say you'll let me in your heart
I should've been there from the start
I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be a heartbreak story

I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be heartbreak story


'''Tom:'''
I'm better
So much better now
I see the light, touch the light,
We're together now

I'm better
So much better now
Look to the skies, give me life
We're together now

'''Max:'''
We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

'''Nathan:'''
They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun

You'll find us chasing the sun

We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming?
And we'll never grow old again
'''Tom:'''
You'll find us chasing the sun

'''Siva:'''
I'm never
I'm never down
Lying here, staring up
And you're looking down

'''Jay:'''
I'm never
I'm never down
Live forever, forever
With you around

'''Nathan:'''
We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

'''Siva:'''
I know you can’t be sleeping
'Cause you’re not anywhere near me
All the way on the other side
Wish that I could read your mind

I’m kissing on your shoulder
But you don’t wanna turn over
You know I’d rather have another fight
Than be a victim of a silent night

'''Max:'''
You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
'''All:'''
And I’ll be wrong as long as we’re alright
'''Max:'''
Call me names, I’ll take them all
This time I’ll take the fall
'''All:'''
And I’ll be wrong as long as we’re alright

'''Jay:'''
Did I hurt your feelings?
You should know I don't mean it
Don’t disguise it, let it all out
Say it's my fault whatever you like now

'''Tom:'''
Used to talk, used to talk
We could talk about everything
So what’s wrong? Let me know
'Cause I can do anything
I’m no good if your heart breaks
So I’ll do whatever it takes

'''Max:'''
You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
'''All:'''
And I’ll be wrong as long as we’re alright

'''Nathan:'''
Tick, tock, looking at the clock
If we take a minute we can make it all stop
Tick, tock, when we’re gonna talk?
Let it out your head, baby, give me all you got tonight
Let me make it better

You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how

'''Jay:'''
How can I
Hold a mirror up to your eyes?
Speak the way
You can understand what’s inside

You've been broken down
In a thousand different ways
I've been looking over pictures
And you hardly looked the same
I can see it from a mile
That the way you smile is changed
But you don’t know

'''Nathan:'''
It is hard for me to sit
And watch you getting sick
When all I wanna do is try

'''All:'''
Only you can dig yourself out
Just before you break down, girl, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up
Just before you get stuck, yeah

All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you, so hurry up now
Just before you run out of time

'''Max:'''
Before you run out of time

'''Siva:'''
Beautiful
That’s the only way I see you
Nobody else
Can love you in the way that I do

Sometimes I get worried
That you are taking on too much
And this crazy world where we live
In doesn't really give a fuck
If only we could paddle
To a place when it was just you and I

'''Tom:'''
It is hard for me to sit
And watch you getting sick

Too much of anything can make you sick
Even the good can be a curse 
Makes it hard to know which road to go down
Knowing too much can get you hurt.

Is it better? Is it worse?
Are we sitting in reverse
It's just like we're going backwards. 

I know where I want this to go
Driving fast but let?s go slow
What I don't wanna do is crash nooo.

Just know you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growing apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back, back to the start.oh

Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more.

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
If it's' worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh

Now everyday ain't gon' be no picnic
Love aint a walk in the park
All you can do is make the best of it now

Can't be afraid of the dark.

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for 

I don't know where I'm heading,ohh
I'm willing and ready to go.
We've been driving so fast
We just need to slow down
And just ro-o-o-o-o-oll.

Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more.

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
It's worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...


When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down on your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down on your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


You want me to come over I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious we should be facing the truth

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'

And the love kick starts again
Starts again
And The Love kick starts again
Starts again

Its the same old you the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wondering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet

I realize what I got when I'm out of town
Cos deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No I don't wanna let you down no no no

You want me to come over I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious we should be facing the truth

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
Kick-Kickstarts again

Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'

And the love kick starts again
Starts again
And the love kick starts again
Starts again
And the love kick starts again

Start to think it could be fizzling out (Starts again)
Jay, Nathan & Siva:
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts (Starts again)
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
Love kickstarts again 

Start to think it could be fizzling out (Starts again)
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts (Starts again)
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'

And the love kick starts again.


Now this melody's a healer
It's got my baby in a fever
And I hope it gets the better of you
With this Morricone music
There's no way you can refute it
But girl you ain't got nothing to lose

Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh
It's not who you know
When I'm what you know
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me
Aye aye aye, girl gone gone gone
Don't want a room full of snakes
If the lights are on and
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me

Will the angel or the devil
Die in ecstasy
There's something coming over you
Come over me
Falling in love is never easy
'Cause they're so good
I'm so bad, so let's get ugly

Now she's a gentle mental
Got perversions detrimental
But there's times
I just don't know what to do.
She's all grown up and sexy
And I know she's not my baby
But man, I ain't got nothing to lose

Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh
It's not who you know
When I'm what you know
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me
Aye aye aye, girl gone gone gone
Don't want a room full of snakes
If the lights are on and
Aye aye aye,
Just come and go with me

Will the angel or the devil
Die in ecstasy
There's something coming over you
Come over me
Falling in love is never easy
'Cause they're so good
I'm so bad, so let's get ugly

It's never easy
The good the bad
The good the bad
Good bad Good Bad
Let's get ugly

Will the angel or the devil
Die in ecstasy
There's something coming over you
Come over me
Falling in love is never easy
'Cause they're so good
I'm so bad, so let's get ugly


If Nathan won't do it
If Tom won't do it
And Jay won't do it
Then go for Siva's model pout instead

If Max didnt hide it
If Nathan didn't hide it
Then why can't I find it
All the guys have tried it on now
And looked wrong somehow

So I'm getting my pout ready 
Getting my pout ready now

It's a band photo
We gotta get into a nice straight row
Hope you can't see the creases and they've ordered the pizzas 
Being a heart-throb ain't easy you know
Guess what time we get up get up now

Cause Max won't wash it 
And Jay won't wipe it 
Don't mean to drop it
But cleaning just drives us out 

Of our heads
When I'm handed pictures to sign and I'm trying to be patient
But girls all go berserk for their screaming adoration
Because they say it helps. 
It's to maximize flirtation but I must get back to this shoot

This bit's slow mo, then we get back into a nice straight row
As our fame increases schedules on press releases
And so our fans already know exactly where to go now

I wonder if I'll be the solo star but I'm worried if I do depart
Then my place in the band will go 
And it'll break up our nice straight row 
Row row row row row 
We're all standing 
Slow mo slow mo slow mo

It's a band photo we gotta get into a nice straight row
How you cant see the creases and they've ordered the pizzas 
Being a heart-throb ain't easy you know
Guess what time we get up get up now


From the get-go,
I knew this was hard to hold
Like a crash,
The whole thing spun out of control
Oh, on a wire, we were dancing

Two kids, no consequences
Pull the trigger without thinking
There's only one way down this road

[Chorus]

It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it
Let's diffuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way

[Verse 2]

Well, there's no way out of this,
So let's stay in
Every storm that comes also comes to an end
Oh, resistance is useless
Just two kids stupid and fearless
Like a bullet shooting the lovesick
There's only one way down this road

[Chorus]

It was like a time bomb set into motion

We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it
Let's diffuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way

[Bridge]

Got my heart in your hands
Like a time bomb ticking
It goes off; we start again
When it breaks, we fix it
Got your heart in my hands
Like a time bomb ticking
We should know better
But we won't let go

[Chorus]

It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you let me go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it
Let's diffuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way



How could I see You when I was so blind
How could I grasp You when I was far behind
How could I hear You when I was so deaf
How could I get up when I had been left

But You said don’t worry
For I’ve healed the blind man
And I’ve set the captives free
And You said don’t worry
For all you’ve gotta do
Is put your trust in Me

How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole 
Make me whole
Make me whole again




Living in fear is not what You had in mind for me
But holding to You is so hard
I cling to what I see

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You’re piercing me
This self will bleed
You’re killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I’ll ever need is You

Here in this haze a distant light 
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You’re piercing me
This self will bleed
You’re killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I’ll ever need is You




Through this skin You see my heart
Through this laughter You feel my pain
Even through this mask You see my face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
And You search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

Growing up never comes easily
In Your hands, You’re the potter molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
And You search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

My Father 
My Father
You are my Father 
Oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry 
Even at the midnight

And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
And You search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me




Hello hello I'm searching for a man
With love-filled eyes and them healing hands
Hello hello I've been waiting for so long
Don't disconnect me cause it's my last call

CHORUS(1):
For help
Yeah help
For help

'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name

Don't wanna leave, don't wanna say goodbye
Still fifteen minutes for my thirty-five
And where's this good in goodbye?
Cause talking to you is bringing me

This life
Yeah life
This life 
Yeah

'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name

'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name

This is my last call




You would think that I could find a simple song 
A photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD 
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me you see

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways

I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

I don't regret, I'm not ashamed 
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways
As the wisest of men 
Oh, perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful 
To be a part of the family tree 
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete

Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways

Time after time 
One more time and again 
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old I am told it’s the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying

Oh, baby don’t worry about a thing




I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears

And I cry

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

I listen to these voices 
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girls bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears

Oh, and I cry

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

Where can I go, where can I hide
from these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge

No more tears

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 




If You came by me would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though I really didn't see
If You walked by my side would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name would never be denied

But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it 
So, spit in Your face and passed You by
I'd forgotten those words "Your name won't be denied"

But time and time again I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad but I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday, but not this day I said
I wanted to live my life I was willing to pay the price

But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it 
So, spit in Your face and passed You by
I'd forgotten those words "Your name won't be denied"

But looking into my eyes I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You bad, my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain, this guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away if I were to give you back my life?

But You said "I've forgiven thee"
And You said "I've forgiven thee" 

He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns on His head 

But You said "I've forgiven thee"
And You said "I've forgiven thee" 




You could throw me in the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith is your desire
And your love endures

You could throw me in the prison cell
Shackle me up against the rail
But time and time again
My faith won't fail 

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail

You could throw me in the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace surrounds me
And it sets me free

And I can walk upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are set upon You
And no one can bring me down

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail

For His angels surround me
And you've poured out this blood covering
And I will walk and not fail
For time and time again My faith won't fail 

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail




Did it seem to disappoint you living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma, out of control
No one seems to give the answers that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here

Miles and miles of lies behind you
Those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you
Help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

Heaven waits 
The hours of silence finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

I love you 
I have and I always will

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you




When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left to say
I'll say it all again 
But until then

And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do Jesus

No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do Jesus

When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before



I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys

I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be sayin' now
You know I like my boys a little bit older

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
Be undercover lovers, under the covers 

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your love, love
I just wanna use your love, love
I just wanna use your love, love, love...

Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
But I can't stop the way I'm feeling

As you leave, please could you just close the door?
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
Go find a shoulder to cry upon 

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight...

I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love now baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)

(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all)

I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song
Singin' this song song song song song


I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So, if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light?
Is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?

I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down 'cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight

That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys

So over the summer something changed
I started reading seventeen
And shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school
And caught you staring at me

'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight

That I just wanna be
Your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream
And not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team

And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be...

'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight

That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys


This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it


You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID 
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby


Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...

You're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through and
Bust down the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay


How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?

Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down the man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you?

I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you
To say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man

You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be
A real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem,
Our future could solve 'em, baby.
I could bring you to life,
If you let me inside, baby
This'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man

You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,
A toy, could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand
But you're not a man

You're not a man,
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,
But you're not a man

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down...


If you want me,
The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The crème de la crop,
If you want me you better do better than that tonight
Oh, oh

If you want me, it takes more than a wink,
More than a drink,
More than you think,
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight

'Cause some don't have the patience,
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill,
'Cause that's the deal

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass,
A one night stand, a storage shed,
I think you better walk by tonight,
Oh no

If you want me,
Then stop begging,
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight

But I don't need your dollar bills,
I just want something real,
'Cause nothing's free,
Except loving me

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me

If you want me,
The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The crème de la crop

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford...

If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check

For me, for me,

I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade

Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?

Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?


Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
And my heart is still wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map that tells a story what a souvenir 
of Young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

And I cover up these scars

And I can't stop seeing stars

Whenever you're around
Around

I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oohhh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

I can't stop no I can't stop
no I can't stop
Ohh, I'm going out in flames
Ohh, I'm going down in flames
Ohhhh
Baby you are the weapon I choose
Baby you are the weapon I choose...



I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
‘Cause I'm sending all the signs

That the clock is ticking, 
And I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We’re going down for sure
Already lost the grip
Best abandon ship, oh-oh

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education 
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
‘Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It’s all for the better 
That we end this here
Let’s close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We’re going down for sure
And we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost

‘Cause I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We’re going down for sure
Already lost the grip
Best abandon ship, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
Oh-oh-oh-oh


Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75
Isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more than an ex
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Ohh I won't settle no oh 
Oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history 
Rather than end up 
Begging on the streets
Trading undertable favors
For a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this 
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention

I wanna break the mold 
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it 
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints

Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints in the END


I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
The introduced me was always just a friend,
I bought a new dress he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it

You were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
Said I was pretty and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention

Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to being loved the right way
I want to argue but there is nothing to say

Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love I think I'm ready

'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
(So scared) to feel this way

But love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love I think I'm ready


I take these turns a bit too fast,
Trying to leave you in my past.
The CD skips our favorite songs,
Our greatest hits just don't belong.

I really love to hate this,
Love, hate hate-love,
Relationships, are over-rated.
Over my dead body,
Is how this will end.

You said "it's over",
And I could go for,
Another chance to do,
This over again.

So this is it?
After all we've been through?
We called it quits,
And now I'm about to.
I've lost my grip,
Or the little I had left.

You said "it's over",
And I could really go for,
A cup of coffee,
And an overdose.
Leave it all behind me,
You'll see it,
When you finally find me,
Comatose or pretty close.

Cup of coffee,
And an overdose.

I pop these pills like cracker jacks,
And the price that plays dice,
Just watching you react.
When your depressed you sleep too much,
I'm not sure if i'm waking up.

It's over-rated.
Over my dead body,
Is how this will end.

You said "it's over",
And I could go for,
Another chance to do,
This over again.

So this is it?
After all we've been through?
We called it quits,
And now I'm about to.
I've lost my grip,
Or the little I had left.

You said "it's over",
And I could really go for,
A cup of coffee,
And an overdose.
Leave it all behind me,
You'll see it,
When you finally find me,
Comatose or pretty close.

Cup of coffee,
And an overdose.

You said "it's over",
And I could really go for,
A cup of coffee,
And an overdose.
Leave it all behind me,
You'll see it,
When you finally find me,
Comatose or pretty close.

I stood in line,
Without you, oh-oh-oh,
I stood in line,
Without you, I, I-I-I,
I stood in line.

I stood in line without you,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh),
And I don't tell you,
My little every thought,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh),
(I stood in line without you),
(I stood in line without you),
About you, well without you,
(I stood in line without you, eh),
Is everything I've got.

I stood in line without you,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh),
And I don't tell you,
(Yeah, I'll be fine as soon as I've),
My little every thought,
(Left your pretty face).
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh).
About you, well without you,
Is everything I've got.

I stood in line without you,
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, no-oh).


This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it


I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
Oh no no no no no no no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!


I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in Period One
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in LA
That seems to be where everybody
Else ends up these days

And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah

I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you


Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...

You're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through and
Bust down the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay


I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends

Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So, if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light?
Is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?


You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID 
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby


The weight of my words are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep, I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies smell like a big old bucket of bleach
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key, you won't open up for me

So brick by brick, I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

And it feels like you're in China and I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh boy, can't you just get used to something so right?
And sure I confess: I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away

So brick by brick, I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

'Cause if you give up, then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you

So brick by brick, I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not giving, giving up
I'm not giving, giving up
Oh baby, don't give up on this love


All along the western front 
People line up to receive 
She got the current in her hand 
To shock you like you won't believe 

Saw her in the Amazon 
With the voltage running throughout her skin 
Standing there with nothing on 
She's gonna teach me how to swim 

Oh, ooh, ooh 

Said, "Ooh, ooh girl shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

Said, "Ooh, girl ooh, shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

All along the eastern shore 
Put your circuits in the sea 
This is what the world is for 
Making electricity 

Cause you can feel it in your mind 
Oh you can do it all the time 
Plug it in and change the world 
Yes, you are my electric girl 

I said, "Ooh, ooh girl shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

Said, "Ooh, girl ooh, shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel" 

Oh, oh yea 

Hey, hey 

Do what ya feel now 
Electric feel now 

Do what ya feel now 
Electric feel now 

Do what ya feel now 
Electric feel now


Mmm
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

Mmm

I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
(Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold)

Mmm
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
I don't wanna be either
I wanna be, next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down...


I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than...

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like...

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothin' there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
Oh no no no no no no no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like, no you don't even like
No you don't even like... penis!


You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight


There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well...

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well...

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards

Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again 
This Friday night

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Last Friday night

'''''Snoop Dogg'''''
Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

'''''Katy Perry'''''
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle (ooh)
Oooh oh oooh

California girls (California), we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast), now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

'''''Snoop Dogg'''''
Toned, tan, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy my lady (yeah)
You looking here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (oh yeah)

'''''Katy Perry'''''
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh (c'mon, c'mon)

Oooh oh oooh (ey, ey)

'''''Snoop Dogg'''''
(California, California girls)
California girls, man
(California, California girls)
I really wish you all could be California girls


Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

This is the last time you say 
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday, nothing to celebrate

You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank

I thought that I was the exception
I could rewrite your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype

You think you're so rock 'n roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fucking choked

Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
You're going down, you're going down, you're going down

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down


Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one, without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)

In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away


You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say, "Be afraid.
You're not like the others."
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your power
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial



I can feel a phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there

It’s never easy to be chosen
Never easy to be called
Standing on the front line
When the bombs start to fall
And I can see the heavens
But I still hear the flames
Calling out my na-ame

I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the e-end of it all
Who am I living for?

I can feel this light that’s inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle
the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that’s the price

It’s never easy to be chosen
Never easy to be called
Standing on the front line
When the bombs start to fall
And I can see the heavens
But I still hear the flames
Calling out my na-ame

I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the e-end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the e-end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don’t let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don’t let the greatness get you down

I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the e-end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can’t ignore this war
At the e-end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?




She is a pyramid
But with him she's just a grain of sand
This love's too strong like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in

She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe, she's become, a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

She was unstoppable
Move fast just like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement wishing that they never ever met

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe, she's become, a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a...

Do you know that there's a way out, there's a way out, there's a way out, there's a way out
You don't have to be held down, be held down, be held down, be held down

'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world
My world, oh yeah

But I will come, and grow strong
And I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

You don't have to be a shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong, and you'll learn, that you can still go on
And you'll always be a, a pearl

She is unstoppable


You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time every time when you're touching me
I'll make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one bosomed energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science, we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

And even when seasons change, our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
You spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles just to find the magic seed
Oh, what flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet

Always on the brink of a heart attack
You give me life and keep me coming back
I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

Even when seasons change, our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
You spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me, never love me not
Not
I know when we were in perfect harmony, you make me sound like
Like a symphony, oh

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat


He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know, when you know
I don't know

I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming that I could?

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah

Snow White said when I was young "one day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you cant see the sign, wait for it
One hundred percent, with every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And thats just the beginning

Oh yeah, 'cause I know you're out there
And your, your looking for me, ooh
It's a crazy idea that you were made perfectly for me
You'll see

Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending
Oh, it's not like the movies
Oh, but that's how it will be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning

Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh woah

So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah
Except for me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me, no
Away from me
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no


I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart 
I'm wide awake 
How did I read the stars so wrong?

I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down

Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Outta the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down

Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm) Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah I'm letting you go, I'm) I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I'm wide awake
I am trying to hold on

I'm wide awake
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
(I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake

Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm) Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah I'm letting you go, I'm) I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake


Dressin' up (dressin' up)
For you (for you)
Dressin' up (dressin' up)
For you (for you)

Saucer of milk, table for two
You wanna pet my kitty? You're such a dirty doggie
It's your lucky night, 'cause I'm in the mood
I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty

Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

I could tell your obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

Pick a part you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
(Dressin' up)

You're getting hot so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever, let's take your temperature
Better behave or a police officer will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve

Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tied, tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling (trembling, trembling)

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your 9 to 5
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you

I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm tryin' to bathe my ehhy ehhy in your milky way way
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I'll be reverend
I'll be so far u-u-u-u-up, we don't give a fuh-uh-uh

Welcome to the danger zone, step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big-headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot

You're so hypnotizing

Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating

You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your power
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes

'''''Kanye West'''''
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada spacesuit about the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars

Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next: alien sex
I'ma disrobe you, then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you, so I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well...

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well...

It's a blacked out blur

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey (yeah)
The one (uh)
Baby you're a
California gurls

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Imma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight (tonight)
(Youuuuuuuuu)

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

You could travel the world,
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)

In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding my head

You're so hypnotizing

Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating

Boy, boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, 
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon


I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly
Agreed politely

I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all
I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all
I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
You're gonna hear me roar

Oh...
Oh... ''(And you'll hear me roar)''
Oh...
You're gonna hear me roar

Roar, oh, roar, oh, roar

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... ''(yeah)''
You're gonna hear me roar

Oh...
Oh... ''(you'll hear me roar)''
Oh...
You're gonna hear me roar


Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary
La, la, la, la, la

Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la

Ah-ooh! (Shakara) Ooh!

Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
La, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers

If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer

With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don't care

Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug

You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life

With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes

And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night

'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive

And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now

So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor

There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now

I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now
I see through you now


I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me

Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you're in love, in love with

So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more standing in my own way
Let's go deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
The way I want you to love me

No more standing in my own way
Let's go deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
The way I want you to love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining 
Who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to
Love me


Can you tell me
Who called a race
Can anyone stay in one place
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time

But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me

All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me
Be here with me now

Do you ever think that
We're just chasing our tails
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize

But you know who I
Who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me

All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me
Be here with me now

Be here with me now

'Cause the future is right now
Right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now
I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me

All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me
Be here with me now


You're a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks and opens the gold mine

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you it was all pitter-patter

Secretly, hit the lottery 'cause you're
Brighter than all of the Northern lights
You speak to me even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price

They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

To the bottom of the sea I'd go to find you
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you
Every step I take I'm keeping you in mind

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime


Was 27, surviving my return to Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

Thought I wasn't enough
Found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore

By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh I can finally see myself again

I know I am enough
Possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the Universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

Oh
That way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love
In the name of love
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
Looked in the mirror
By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way


Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues

I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

You make me float
You make me float

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

Oh, oh-oh
You make me float
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
You make me float


Is Mercury in retrograde,
Or is that the excuse that I've always made
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself

Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent

Oh yeah

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
Let me be first, baby 
To say I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I'll face my demons - yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could, too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself

Oh, I can only be the change you want to see
Yeah, to see

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent, yeah

Oh-oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
Let me be first, baby 
To say I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror, and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way
Is it too late to change

Oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent

Oh-oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
Let me be first, baby 
To say I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry


You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mine
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy
All you really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I'm not fighting anymore

I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
We're cursed just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy
All you really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I'm not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway
I'm not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more 

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I'm not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more...


You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey
Sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary

I wipe my hands on your jeans
'Cause they are more distressed
So they say you've got a CD
And they claim you can barely read
But you say don't bother me with all of your reality

But it could be so simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple

(Don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
'Cause you bought too much Vuitton

You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your I's and dot your T's
All it goes to show

That it could be so simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple

(Don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to reevaluate
The possibilities
The situations

The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I

It could, it could be that simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple

(Don't know what you were thinking)
You're in a haze
It's just a phase
You know this maze
Is as simple as it seems

We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please

And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
'Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems

It is all so simple
Just deal with it 


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way


You hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas
It appears you like beer 
I like a foreign accent
You just say "What?
What the hell they say?" 
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but that's okay

Sometimes I like to trade you in 
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while I'm breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to

Sometimes I like to trade you in 
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah 

And I will, but you won't
And I do, but, but you don't
We won't budge either way
But we like it, we like it

Sometimes I like to trade you in 
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Let's agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah yeah


I was living in a small mind with no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising

Then it hit me, maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

I was living on a fault line, the fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough, I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff

Then it hit me, you won't permit me
To be an individual just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison

What a high
When you open your mind
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

So long conformity
And ambiguality is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate

I started living outside for the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside

Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
Oh, living outside of the box, of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems that nice


I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
Don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
Cause her love was so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo!
Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil'mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

'''Тёмная Лошадка'''
<lyrics>
Я знала, что ты,
Что ты придёшь ко мне,
И вот ты здесь.
Но тебе стоит выбирать тщательней,
Ведь я способна на всё,
На что угодно...

Сделай меня своей Афродитой,
Сделай своей единственной,
Не делай меня своим врагом, своим врагом, своим врагом...

Значит, ты хочешь поиграть с колдовскими чарами?
Парень, тебе следует знать, во что ты ввязываешься...
Малыш, хватит ли тебе смелости на это,
Ведь я перед тобой - тёмная лошадка.
Готов ли ты, готов ли
К идеальному шторму?
Ведь стоит тебе стать моим,
Пути назад не будет...

Запомни мои слова:
Благодаря этой любви ты воспаришь,
Словно птица,
Словно птица, выпорхнувшая из клетки,
Но рухнешь на землю,
Если захочешь уйти. Не уходи...

Всё начертано на твоей ладони, милый,
Там или "да" или "нет", нет, "быть может",
Так что просто будь уверен, прежде чем вручить мне своё сердце,
Вручить мне своё сердце...

Значит, ты хочешь поиграть с колдовскими чарами?
Парень, тебе следует знать, во что ты ввязываешься...
Малыш, хватит ли тебе смелости на это,
Ведь я перед тобой - тёмная лошадка.
Готов ли ты, готов ли
К идеальному шторму?
Ведь стоит тебе стать моим,
Пути назад не будет...

Она - монстр,
Я зову ее Кармой,
Она слопает твое сердце,
Как Джеффри Дамер.
Будь осторожен,
Старайся не играть с ней.
Сердце этой девчонки было на стероидах -
Настолько сильна была ее любовь.
Ты можешь влюбиться,
Когда встретишь ее,
Если выпадет шанс, постарайся удержать ее.
Она поклянется в любви, но если разобьёшь ей сердце,
Станет ледяной, как морозильник.
Как в конце сказки с рыцарем в сияющих доспехах,
Она может быть моей Спящей Красавицей,
И я введу ее в кому,
Уооу!
Черт, я, кажется, люблю её,
Девочка - отпад.
Я пьян, и мне плевать,
Что с ней я словно на американских горках,
Ведь её спальня - словно парк аттракционов.
Ее любовь как наркотик,
Я пытался бросить,
Но эта крошка так одурманивает,
Что я и не заметил, как подсел на нее...

Значит, ты хочешь поиграть с колдовскими чарами?
Парень, тебе следует знать, во что ты ввязываешься...
Малыш, хватит ли тебе смелости на это,
Ведь я перед тобой - тёмная лошадка.
Готов ли ты, готов ли
К идеальному шторму?
Ведь стоит тебе стать моим,
Пути назад не будет...


I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
Its like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
Its like
The force of gravity
In full effect

I got money to burn
And im on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause im their ace of spades

I feel the walls
Getting closer
Im like a bomb
With all red wires

All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
Im gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
Im gonna be

A diamond
It wont ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

If not for the push
Id probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
Id be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures

I dont wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am i not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That weve been though?

All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
Im gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
Im gonna be

A diamond
It wont ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends
A diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

Ooh oohh diamond
Ive gotta be a diamond
(im a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if i fall)
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh
Yeah yeah yeah

All this pressure
All this pressure
Oh, i've gotta be
Oh, i've gotta be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Oh, i've gotta be
Oh, i've gotta be

Im a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if i fall
Into the arms of a coma

All this pressure
I've got pressure
Im gonna be a diamond baby
I've gotta be a diamond
Your gonna see
I'm gonna be a diamond

I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have--

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls-- they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls--they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun,
They want to have fun,
They want to have fun...

Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
You've got
Too much talent

I see you
Through those
Bloodshot eyes
There's a cure

You've found it
Slow motion
Sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it

But boys will be boys
Oh, yes they will
They don't want
To define it

Just give up the game
And get into me
If you're looking
For thrills
Then get cold feet

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow

If you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants

And your heart
On your sleeve

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up

I fall deep
'Cause the more you try
The harder I'll fight
To say good night

I can't cook, no
But i can clean
Up the mess you left
I lay your head down
And feel the beat
As i kiss
Your forehead
This may not
Last but this is now
So love the one
You're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing
Your tail
Quick fix
Won't ever
Get you well

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more
You try
The harder
I'll fight
To say goodnight

Cause i feel
The distance
Between us
Could be over
With a snap
Of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more
You try
The harder
I'll fight
To say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
Cause i don't wanna
Miss out


I was raised on Sundays and one ways
A room with glass stained views
Picture perfect washed in the words 
That were my only truth

It's not that I'm letting you go
Oh but now I'm a grownup
And I need to know

I'll make mistakes 
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me I'll bend
'Cause I can

Scared of asking too many questions
Scared to make the choice
From the beginning you'll be my ending
If you can hear my voice

'Cause it's not that I'm giving you up
Oh your name is engraved oh and so is your love

But I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me I'll bend
'Cause I can

Oh always, there's always
Times we have to leave
Oh but I know that 
When I need you
Oh you will rescue me

Oh I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me I'll bend
'Cause I can
 
When the world tries to break me I'll bend
'Cause I can


What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone or did you bring all your friends?
Say, whats your name, what you drinking
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby what's your sign, tell me yours I'll tell you mine
Say, whats somebody like you doing in a place like this
One, two, three, come one

[Chorus]
I'll never be the same, if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away, said, if we ever meet again
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same
If we ever meet again

Say if we ever meet again

Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more
Baby tell me what's your story
I ain't shy, don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
So do you come here much, I gotta see your face some more, some more

Cause baby I

[Chorus]

If we ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say (if we ever meet again)

If we ever meet again
I won't let you go away (said if we ever meet again)

If we ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say (say if we ever meet again)

If we ever ever meet again
I won't let you go away

[Chorus: x2]



You come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on, off
Disconnected, I'm effected
Better take the call

Showed you pictures of my hometown
A pin could drop from miles down
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend when I know just what we are?
There's nothing, in common
Except the bed we lay on

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

You're a habit I can't break, disaster to eliminate
What part of "no" do I not understand when you're not good for me?

'Cause I know we will never be some kind of forever

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

'Cause I'm the girl who makes it all of nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no

Hey, yeah
Oh, it's empty in between

You come over
Yeah, it's over
Now we know just what we are

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

I'm the girl who makes it all of nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end

No
Oh, it's empty in between

Oh, yeah
Uh huh uh oh
Uh huh uh oh, yeah
Uh huh uh oh
Uh huh uh oh, you know
Uh huh uh oh


This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity

I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve

If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then'll type it bold when I spell it out
I T S L O V E

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum, oh, oh, oh
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum, oh

So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
(Second guess every move that you make)

This was big for us
Changing you and me

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

Oh, somebody tell me
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah

I made it through
The wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat incomplete
I'd been had
I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Chorus:
Like a virgin
Touched
For the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
(After first time
With your heartbeat)
Next to mine

Gonna give you
All my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong
Yeah
You make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah
Your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

(Chorus)

Oooh, oooh, oooh

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah
You made me feel
I've nothing to hide

(Chorus)

Like a virgin
Ooh, ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Can't you hear
My heart beat
For the very
First time?

The leaves were falling
I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips
Grabbing hips
Smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990
Had me down from out of town
I was california
Oh my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave
But hey

It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
Its not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
Its not like taking a bath
Its not like having a laugh
Its not like reading a  map
There's nothing like the first time

I had seen it in the 
Magazines
We would 
Change the chanel 
On the tv screen
Cuz it's such a sin
What ya did to me
Straight to hell its what they sell
If you've done the deed
Oh but what could be so bad 
Oh if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'cause I've heard

It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite

Its not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
Its not like taking a bath
Its not like having a laugh
Its not like reading a  map
There's nothing like the first time

Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember

La la la la la la
Theres nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time

It's not a walk in the park
Its not a shot in the dark
Its not a juvenile crime
Theres nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot
Theres nothing like the first time
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Theres nothing like the first time
Oh oh ohhh
Theres nothing like the first time
Hey ey ey 
Theres nothing like the first time

It's not like reading a map
Oh I can give you that
Theres nothing like the first time


We can?t keep playing house
With such a big world outside
How do we shut it out?
At a fork in the road
Should I stay or should I go?
I?ll keep the cat
Leave a spare under the mat
If you need to crash one day	

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don?t you think we?re just too young
To play these grown up games?

Cause you know me too well
It?d be like me lying to myself
But I?m so scared to be alone
And go back to sleeping with the lights on

Cause I can be myself
Drunk or sober fat proactive poster
Wouldn?t it be nice 
If we were older

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don?t you think we?re just too young
To play these grown up games

Some days I wanna take my chances

Not live so modernized
Some day I wanna be a Mrs.
But it?s not yet quite right
No it?s not yet quite right

So there go our future children?s names
I put the rest of us in a box in the closet
That I cannot open without getting full
Full of emotion
Because you know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don?t you think we?re just too young
To play 

One day I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
One day I wanna be a Mrs.
But it?s not yet quite right
No it?s not yet quite right
No it?s not yet quite right


Twelve noon
Watch her sleeping in your room
Why cant that still be me
Two o'clock and I'm still driving round your block
Feeling a little
Crazy

You changed your number and moved to the suburbs
You run but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising is that look on your face

I am underneath your street light
Blowing kissing every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window
Throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

So weeks pass and I found myself another chatch
Someone who loves me equally, yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me

He bought me a big ring we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now your showing up at my place
Not surprising we both play this game

You're underneath my street light
Blowing kisses every night

Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window
Throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la
La la la la

You changed your number and moved to the suburbs
You run but you cant hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising that look on your face

I am underneath your street light
Blowing kissing every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window
Throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

I am underneath your street light
Blowing kissing every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window
Throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love

(feat. Ferras)

I kissed your sweet lips
I floated so high
Your eyes looked at mine
The world froze in time
What is this feeling?
I am on cloud nine
Guess
I'm still reeling
From your body
Next to mine

It's a rush
I can't explain
Like you shot
Something crazy
Into my veins
And I'm ten feet
Off the ground
And I don't want
To come down
Don't want
To come down

I know
You're sleeping
I wish you
Were right here
'Cause my bed's so empty
I'd hold you so close dear
And I sang my song to you
Your smile was priceless
What else can I do?

I'm a junkie over you

It's a rush
I can't explain
Like you shot something
Crazy into my veins
And I'm ten feet
Off the ground
And I don't want
To come down

Is it me
Or is everything spinning
I'm wide awake
But I must be dreaming
It's like
You're some kind of drug
Try to catch my breath
And see
If I'm still breathing
Touch my heart
And make sure
It's beating
It's like
I'm falling in love

It's a rush
I can't explain
Like you shot
Something crazy
Into my veins
And I'm ten feet
Off the ground
And I don't
No I don't
No
Don't want
To come down
Don't want
To come down
Gonna come down


Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go
That's the way they all come through like
Low cut, see through shirts that make ya
That's the way she come through like

'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce

How do I say I'm sorry
'Cause the word is just never gonna come out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce

Tight jeans, double D's makin' me go
All the people on the street know
Iced out, lit up make the kids go
All the people on the street know

'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce

How do I say I'm sorry
'Cause the word is just never gonna come out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce

Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know

Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know

I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce


What are you lookin' at?
(Yeah)

I saw this coming
From a mile away
I saw a crack
In the egg
A little rip
In the page

I found
Your necklace
On the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

You thought i'd cry
(You-thought-i'd-cry)
You thought i'd lay
Down and die
You thought
There's no
Hetting over you
(Ha-ha)

And all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having
Your fun
I've been having
Some fun too

Cause' it
Takes one to know one
Congrats
You've met your match
You think I'd lie here
Heartbroken
But the knife
Is in your back
(In-your-back)

You left your suit
You left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it
Was business baby
(Yeah right)

And when you left
I got a call
That started it all
And now
It's not your business
Ba-by

You thought i'd cry
(You-thought-i'd-cry)
You thought i'd lay
Down and die
You thought
There's no
Getting over you
(Ha-ha)

But all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having
Your fun
I've been having
Some fun too

Cause' it
Takes one to know one
Congrats
You've met your match
You think i'd lie here
Heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife
Is in your back
(In-your-back)

You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come
Back to me
Oh
(Ahhhh)

And i'll let you

Hey
Huh
You're back

Cause' it takes one
To know one
Congrats
You've met your match
You think
I'd lie here
Heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife
Is in you're back
(In-your-back)

Cause' it
Takes one to know one
(Hi, nice to meet you)
Congrats
You've met your match
You think
I'd lie here
Heartbroken
(I'll-lie-here)
But the knife
Is in your back
(In-your-back)


When I wanted you
You would not reciprocate
When I needed you
You would always show up late
But things have changed
And I've got the upper hand
You come runnin’, I've got you eating 
Out of my hand

That's more like it. Yeah, that's more like it!
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it… That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it! Yeah, that’s more like it!
Get to work and give me money
That's more like it!
That's more like it! 

When my birthday came
You would not remember it
When I got my period
You were inconsiderate
But tables turn
And it's great to be on top
I’ve got trained to appreciate 
The good that you've got

That's more like it. Yeah, that's more like it!
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it… That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it! Yeah, that’s more like it!
It's great to be the last one laughing
That's more like it!
That's more like it! 
(That's more like it… That's more like it)

I like chocolate and I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere and I want diamonds
I’m ready for my massage right now… right now

That's more like it. Yeah, that's more like it!
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it… That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it! Yeah, it's about time
Get to work and give me money 
That's more like it!
That's more like it! 
(That's more like it… That's more like it)


(That's more like it… That's more like it)
(Yeah, that's more like it!)


I took advantage of you a stepping stone to my pedestal
When you had enough of it 
I said fine good luck replacing this
Cause I seem strong and independent self sufficient, confident
And I'm like mercury rising to the top so selfishly

The better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without a bee without you
I gotta find ya gotta, remind ya
That two is better than one

So please accept my apology cause I'm feeling
Like a branch without its tree
It took me a fall to really see
That your the catch I wanna keep

'Cause I get weak thinking about you
Living without you life has no value
Baby come back to me
'Cause you're the only missing piece

'Cause the better half of me was you

I'm like the hive without its bee without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya
That two is better than one

Ooh it took a little earthquake
To appreciate the stability you've given me
So consistently

The better half of me was you
I'm like a bird without its wings without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya
That two is stronger than one

The better half of me, oh its you
I'm like a heart without its beat without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya
I promise you that I'm gotta try to
I'm gonna love ya cause two is better than one


I was living in a small mind
With no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising

Then it hit me
Maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

I was living on a fault line
The fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough
I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff

Then it hit me
You won't permit me
To be an individual
Just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison

What a high
When you open your mind for the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

So long conformity
And ambiguality is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to seperate

I started living outside for the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside

Ha ha ha

I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation

Oh, living outside of the box
Of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems that nice


Remember last summer, 
Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish were together forever, 
And let nobody tear us apart.

And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos,
And we got sick by the side of the road. 

And the fall came, 
And we had that big pot lot party; 
And your little sixteen year old brother, 
Spilt wine all over my carpet. 
And I got mad, you thought it was funny, 
I stayed mad all winter;
It's so sad, 
A thing like that, 
Becomes such a splinter.

I tried it your way, 
But I got nothing to show.
It's been the same, same, 
And the story's getting old. 
So, I guess the driveway, 
Is the end of the road. 
For us it's too, late. 
Let the credits start to roll.

I'm almost twenty-three, 
And I'm barely hanging on.
I can't keep crashing couches 
And going to sleep at dawn.
And when were you going to take me somewhere that I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up. 
Do you ever wanna clean up?

We share a car, you thought it was okay;
You couldn't have cut it closer. 
I'm sick of it, this is it;
And now the party's over.

I tried it your way, 
But I got nothing to show. 
It's been the same, same, and
The story's getting old. 
So, I guess the driveway, 
Is the end of the road. 
For us it's too, late. 
Let the credits start to roll.

Someday, you'll make, some girl, happy;
I know, you'll get though.
You'll know, just what, to say, to do;
Because I showed you.

I tried it your way, 
But I got nothing to show.
It's been the same, same, 
And the story's getting old. 
So, I guess the driveway, 
Is the end of the road. 
For us it's too, late. 
Let the credits start to roll.

Let the credits start to roll.
Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah.
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway; will be the end of the road.


Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again in a magazine
We laughed out loud 'cause she said
"Remember when this was all a silly dream?"

Now I wake up every day in a different city
A smile on my face, somebody pinch me
She said, "All the world's a stage"
But girl, you know those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me

I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

It's amazing to hear people singing along
Hear the radio playing my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside in the spotlight

Now every now and then on a Friday night
Cruising down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleeping in late
Those were the good days

I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Yeah eh, yeah

I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door


[B.o.b]
You know it’s crazy, ’cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom’s house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn’t tryin’ to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin’ to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I’d figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day’s gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong
 
[Katy Perry]
Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
 
Used to steal your parents’ liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I’d be losing you
 
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
 
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don’t have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
 
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
 
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I’m no longer your muse
 
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
 
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don’t have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]
The one that got away
 
[B.o.b]
I’m falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin’ to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why’d you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
 There was still more story to go
Now look, I’m not insinuating that
You’re some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn’t be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
 
[Katy Perry]
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
 
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don’t have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]
 
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don’t have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away





The owl and the pussy cat went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a five pound note. The owl looked up to the stars above, and sang from a small guitar, oh lovely pussy oh pussy my love, what a beautiful pussy you are you are what a beautiful pussy you are. so they sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the palm trees grow, and there in a wood a piggy wig stood with a ring on the end of his nose his nose a ring on the end of his nose. dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling your ring? said the piggy i will. so they took it away and were married nest day by the turkey who lived on the hill. the dined on mince and slices of quince which they ate with an runcible spoon and hand in hand by the edge of the sand they dance in the light of the moon the moon they danced in the light of the moon.


Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P- Diddy (Hey what's up girl)
Grab ma glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (Let's go)
Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cuz when I leave for the night I ain't comin back

I'm talkin pedicure on our toes toes
Tryin on all our clothes clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones phones

Drop top and playin' our favorite CD's
Goin up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

[CHORUS]
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Im'ma fight
Til we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Im'ma fight
Til we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh

Katy: 
I know a place 
Where the grass is really greener 
Warm, wet and wild 
There must be something in the water 
Sippin' gin and juice 
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys 
Break their necks 
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek 
(at us) 

You could travel the world 
But nothing comes close 
To the golden coast 
Once you party with us 
You'll be falling in love 
Oooooh Oh Oooooh 

California girls 
We're unforgettable 
Daisy Dukes 
Bikinis on top 
Sun-kissed skin 
So hot 
Will melt your popsicle 
Oooooh Oh Oooooh 

California girls 
We're undeniable 
Fine, fresh, fierce 
We got it on lock 
West coast represent 
Now put your hands up 
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
[Justin Bieber]
Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh.
You know you love me, I know you care,
You shout whenever and I'll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart.
Are we an item? girl quit playing,
We're just friends, what are you saying.
Said there's another, look right in my eyes,
My first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was like...

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oooooh,
Like baby, baby, baby noooooooo,
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooh.
Thought you'd always be mine, mine (repeat)


I?ve played the song, 
Now it drives me crazy
I've run the race
Now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours
Is a fading photograph yeah yeah
Now I must approach to life today, 
Seems a little different, 
Hard to say, 
But it looks like the end.

Time?s up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing
Changes nothing changes.
Time?s up 
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train we wait for it
Even when it's gone.

We've surfed the wave
Now we've hit the short end
We?ve squeezed the fruit 
Till there?s no more juice left.
We're both so good
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah
Hey but no one's got to die
We can get it in prospective, 
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it.

Time?s up 
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing
Changes nothing changes.

Time?s up, 
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we turn the lights off 
Love is a train we wait for it
Even when it's gone.

As I'm waving you goodbye 
I want you to smile
Save a picture in your frame
File it right next to my name 
I'm willing to die
For love willing to try
But not willing to lie for love
I know that this cakes already baked
Now its burning burning.

We can get it in prospective, 
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it

Time?s up 
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we slam the door shut,
Didn't you know if nothing
Changes nothing changes.
Times up, 
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we turn the lights off 
Love is a train we wait for it yeah yeah
Even when it's gone.
Time?s up,
Promise this time I get enough, 
Promise this time I'll get it off
Love is a train we wait for it
Even when it's gone

Waking up in Vegas (Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas)

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

For waking up in Vegas (Vegas, Vegas)

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

For waking up in Vegas (Vegas)

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas (Vegas)

That's what you get, baby
For waking up in Vegas
For waking up in Vegas (Vegas, Vegas, Vegas)


Don't like it when you call me precious
Coming out, it sound so vicious
Don't like it when you're sympathizing
With your eyes so patronizing

Never say never
You never thought I wouldn't need you
And neither did I

No more co-dependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
And now I'm wide awake

No more psycho-drama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me I washed my hands clean
Watch me walk away!

Sorry I don't have a tissue
For all your pathetic issues
Sorry I don't feel so sorry
When you touch me
You're in such a hurry

Never say never
You never thought I wouldn't need you
And neither did I

No more co-dependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
And now I'm wide awake
No more psycho-drama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me I washed my hands clean
Watch me walk away! (no more, no more)
Watch me walk away! (no more, no more)
Watch me walk away! (no more, no more)

La la la la la la la la la la la la, oh
Watch me walk away! (no more)
Just watch me walk away!
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Just watch me walk away!
Watch me walk away!
There's nothing you can say
No more
Just watch me walk away!

No more co-dependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
And now I'm wide awake

No more psycho-drama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me I washed my hands clean
Just watch me walk away!


We're looking in the same direction
But you don't see what I see
Just a half moon in your perception
It looks full to me
Oh, my head is caught, caught in clouds
But your buried so, so far down

You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down

The way your pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

Your words can pollute the future
So you should choose carefully
Cynical is a natural born killer
If it were up to me I would say
Let's get you all medicated
So we can get dedicated

You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down

The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

This is not a race
This is the relationship
But you take the cake
At being the worst in it

Try and keep me grounded
You took my faith
And nearly drowned it

This is not a test, this is the relationship
You are the best in being Mr. Negative
You weigh me down

You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down

The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down

The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

You weigh me down
(Me down)


You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

My girl, she ain't the one that I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Cause I've fought against it hard enough to know

That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

My boy, he ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hot to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
Cause you never wanna let that feeling go

When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

Oh, you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love


I saw you
At the grocery store
Oh
You both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost
Of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot
How to pick 'em

If she's the one
I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason
Why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well
This looks like the end
Yeah
We can still be friends
Congratulations

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me the curse
That creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart
Caves in
And you wish
She was me again

And again
And again
And again

Well, someone had
To tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you
Like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just
The one between
Heading no where fast
Sure
It's gonna last forever

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me the curse
That creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart
Caves in
And you wish
She was me

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me the curse
That creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart
Caves in
And you wish
She was me again

And again
And again
And again

Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish
You do


Love can be a many splendored thing
Can't deny the joy it brings
A dozen roses, diamond rings
Dreams for sale and fairy tales
It'll make you hear a symphony
And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool ya every time

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too
I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps callin'
And I keep on fallin'
Over and over again
This sad story always ends the same
Me standin' in the pourin' rain
It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all


Miss Independent, Miss Self-Sufficient
Miss Keep Your Distance, mm
Miss Unafraid, Miss Out of My Way
Miss Don't Let a Man Interfere, no
Miss On Her Own, Miss Almost Grown
Miss Never Let a Man Help Her Off Her Throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never, ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
I said ooh, she fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

Miss Guarded Heart, Miss Play It Smart
Miss If You Wanna Use That Line You Better Not Start, no
But she miscalculated, she didn't wanna end up jaded
And this Miss decided not to miss out on true love, so

By changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found in time she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No Longer Afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love, when love is true

Miss Independent


Everybody's talking
But they don't say a thing
They look at me with sad eyes, but I don't want their sympathy
It's cool you didn't want me
Sometimes you can't go back
By why'd you have to go and make a mess like that
Well, I just have say, before I let go

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out,
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
'Cause what you did was low

No, I don't need your number
There's nothing left to say
'Cept I never thought it'd hurt this much to be saved
My friends are outside waiting
I've gotta go

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out,
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
'Cause what you did was low
What you did was low
What you did was low
What you did was low

I walk out of this darkness
With no sense of regret
And I go with a clear conscience
We both know that you can't say that
This to show
For all the time I loved you so, so

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out,
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
'Cause what you did was low

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out,
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
'Cause what you did was low

Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
'Cause what you did was low


Prayed for an angel
To come in the night
And shine some sweet light on me

Found only strangers
Then you came to me
Just when I'd given up, you gave me love
My world was tumbling down
You turned it around baby

You, you're some kind of miracle
You are, you're a miracle to me

Sweet revelation
That look in your eyes
Your touch in the night

I find the sweetest salvation
In your arms baby
Warm as the morning sun, your tender love
Came and just lifted me up
Look what you've done baby

You, you're some kind of miracle
You are, you're a miracle to me

You brought joy to my heart
I found love in your arms
See what you've done to me
You set my soul so free
You came and you gave me the love that I need 

You, you're some kind of miracle
You are, you're a miracle, a miracle to me
Baby you are, a miracle to me


Blue, I'm getting kinda close to you
Like a shadow I can't lose
Hey, you've been hangin' with me every day
Now you're gettin' in my way
I know you understand me
But don't ya think that maybe it's time to move on

What's up lonely
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me
So what's up lonely

Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side
Can't you find another shoulder, cause I
I wanna leave this broken heart behind
We been wastin' too much time
Find someone else to rain on
I'm really getting' tired of singin' this sad song

What's up lonely
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me
So what's up lonely

Don't wanna give you a reason
To hang around anymore
You won't be hurting my feelings
If you find another broken heart you can lean on



Roll over baby
The time has come
To make a little bit more room
I've hung around you
It's getting tough
I think I'm gonna break down soon
Cuz I remember
Crying in the park
It was getting dark
Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky

So go on
And sleep darlin
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
Well I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
Such a shame
We just missed the train
We just missed the train

Be quiet angel
Don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can't you see me
I'm such a mess
Trying hard to find my way
Do you remember wasting all the time
We were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line,
We were all right

So go on
And sleep darlin
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
Well I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
Such a shame
We just missed the train

Oh why'd that train just pass us by
Didn't anyone see we were stuck at the light
And we would've made it on time

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

So sleep darlin
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
Well I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
And sleep darlin
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
Well I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
Such a shame
We just missed the train



He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme, I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold
If I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
It just ain't right, it just ain't right

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight, hold on tight

Oh 'cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy, hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
Waiting so long
So long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends, he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take

Oh 'cause I don't know
Don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster

Oh oh...beautiful
Oh oh...beautiful disaster


I see how you're tryin to
Weasel your way and boy I
Know how you maneuver
With all your confusion

You tell me that I'm your only,
And how bad that you want me
Then why are you so shady,
If I'm supposed to be your lady?

Why should I believe
Anything you say?
And how could you shame me that way?

Tell me where,
Where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you,
You could play me boy?

You thought that we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
Cuz we both know now

At your beck 'n call

And look who's laughin' now

Against one another but it won't work

I see right through your game boy

And I know exactly what a lame ya' are

You, you try to deny all your actions

For once in your life be a real man

At least give me the proper respect of

The truth

When I already know you did it

Why should I believe
Anything you say?
And how could you shame me that way?

Tell me where
Where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you 
You could play me boy

You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
Cuz we both know now
You that you had us both
At you beck 'n call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now

I see what you do baby
Tryin' to tell me you want me
Can't you just get it through your, 
Get it through your thick head?
Cuz I've seen this game before 
And I'm showin' you the door so
Shut your mouth
I'm not tryin to hear your lies
No not again

No, no not again...

Sorry you couldn't be a better man
Oh...
No no no

No, no, no, no, NO
You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
Cuz we both know now
You thought you had us both
At your beck 'n call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now

Guess you thought wrong

Look who's laughin' now

Anytime you feel like you just can't hold on 
Just hold onto my love and I'll help you be strong
But you're so afraid to lose, and baby I can't reach your heart
I can't face this world that's keeping us apart
When I could be the one to show you
Everything you missed before

What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreaming, but till I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this

Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Oh, like this ''(moment like this)''
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Oh, like this


I wonder how I ever made it through the day
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same
And you don't know why
Then I looked into your eyes
Where the road stretched out in front of me
And I realized

I never lived
Before your love
I never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again
I wasn't really living
I never lived
Before your love

I wanted more than just an ordinary life
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how
I survived without your kiss
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist

I never lived
Before your love
I never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again
I wasn't really living
I never lived
Before your love
I never lived
Before your love

And I don't know why 
Why the sun decides to shine
But you breathed your love into me just in time

I never lived
Before your love
I never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again
I wasn't really living
I never lived
I never lived
Before
Your
Love


Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here 
But something felt so wrong here 
So I'd pray 
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change 
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Breakaway
Breakaway


Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get 
What I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it, you put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get
I get what I want

I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get
I get what I want

Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone


Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes


Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you


What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there

Your eyes they sparkled
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care
You know you did it

I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You are wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you

Always ending, always over
Back and forth, up and down, like a roller coaster
I am breaking that habit today
You know you did it

I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You are wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it babe
Take the hit and walk away
'Cause I'm gone

Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it

I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You are wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
(gone, gone)
Already gone

I'm gone


It's like you're a drug
It's like you're a demon I can't face down
It's like I'm stuck
It's like I'm running from you all the time
And I know I let you have all the power
It's like the only company I seek is misery all around

It's like you're a leech
Sucking the life from me
It's like I can't breathe
Without you inside of me
And I know I let you have all the power
And I realize I'm never gonna quit you over time

It's like I can't breathe
It's like I can't see anything
Nothing but you
I'm addicted to you

It's like I can't think
Without you interrupting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
You've taken over me

It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm not me

It's like I'm lost
It's like I'm giving up slowly
It's like you're a ghost that's haunting me
Leave me alone
And I know these voices in my head are mine alone
And I know I'll never change my ways
If I don't give you up now

It's like I can't breathe
It's like I can't see anything
Nothing but you
I'm addicted to you

It's like I can't think
Without you interrupting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
You've taken over me

It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm not me

I'm hooked on you, I need a fix
I can't take it, just one more hit
I promise I can deal with it
I'll handle it, quit it
Just one more time, then that's it
Just a little bit more to get me through this

I'm hooked on you, I need a fix
I can't take it, just one more hit
I promise I can deal with it
I'll handle it, quit it
Just one more time, then that's it
Just a little bit more to get me through this

It's like I can't breathe
It's like I can't see anything
Nothing but you
I'm addicted to you

It's like I can't think
Without you interrupting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
You've taken over me

It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm not me


I don't believe in the smile that you leave 
When you walk away and say goodbye 
Well, I don't expect the world to move underneath me 
But for God's sake, could you try 
I know that you're true to me 
You're always there, you say you care 
I know that you wanna be mine 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, oh 
Where is your heart 

I don't undertsand, your love is so cold 
It's always me who's reaching out for your hand 
And I've always dreamed that love would be effortless 
Like a petal falling to the ground 
A dreamer following his dream 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, oh 
Where is your heart 

It seems so much is left unsaid 
But you can say anything 
Oh, anytime you need 
Baby, it's just you and me, oh yeah 

I know that you're true to me 
You're always there, you say you care 
I know that you wanna be mine 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, yeah 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, and that's all I'm asking for 
Where is your heart [4x]


You've got your mother and your brother
Every other, undercover
Telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid 
But the truth is that it's cupid 
Baby, loving you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know
The situations getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me, how come you never showed? (show)
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (alone)
So before you start defendin'
Baby, stop all your pretendin'...
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow
Let's get this show on the road today, hey...

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I want a love, I want a fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me, die for me
Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me
Cause if you don't then just leave

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

If you don't have the answer (walk away)
Walk away (just walk away)
Just leave (walk away)
Walk away

Walk away



Is this a dream?
If it is
Please don't wake me from this high
I'd become comfortably numb
Until you opened up my eyes
To what it's like
When everything's right
I can't believe

You found me
When no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through
All of my confusion
The ups and the downs
And you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me
You found me

So, here we are
That's pretty far
When you think of where we've been
No going back
I'm fading out
All that has faded me within
You're by my side
Now everything's fine
I can't believe

You found me
When no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through
All of my confusion
The ups and the downs
And you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me
You found me

And I was hiding
'Til you came along
And showed me where I belong
You found me
When no one else was lookin'
How did you know?
How did you know?

You found me
When no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through
All of my confusion
The ups and the downs
And you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me

(You found me)
(When no one else was lookin')
You found me
(How did you know just where I would be?)
You broke through
All of my confusion
The ups and the downs
And you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
The good and the bad
And the things in between
You found me
You found me


I woke up today
Woke up wide awake
In an empty bed
Staring at an empty room
I have myself to blame
For the state I'm in today
And now dying doesn't seem so cruel
And oh, I don't know what to say
And I don't know anyway, anymore

I hate myself for losing you
I'm seeing it all so clear
I hate myself for losing you
What do you do when you look in the mirror
And staring at you is why he's not here

You got what you deserved
Hope you're happy now
'Cause every time I think of her with you
It's killing me inside
And now I dread each day
Knowing that I can't be saved
From the loneliness of living without you
And oh, I don't know what to
Not sure that I'll pull through
I wish you knew

I hate myself for losing you
And oh, I don't know what to do
Not sure that I'll pull through
I wish you knew, I wish you knew
And oh, I don't know what to say
And I don't know anyway, anymore
No, no

What do you say, when everything you said
Is the reason why he left you in the end
How do you cry when every tear you shed
Don't ever bring him back again


Hear me, hear me
You gotta be out there
You gotta be somewhere
Wherever you are
I'm waiting…
'Cause there are these nights when
I sing myself to sleep
And I'm hoping my dreams bring
You close to me
Are you listening?

Hear me I'm crying out
I'm ready now
Turn my world upside down
Find me
I'm lost inside the crowd
It's getting loud
I need you to see
I'm screaming for you to please
Hear me

Can you hear me?

I used to be scared of
Letting someone in
But it gets so lonely
Being on my own
With no one to talk to and
No one to hold me
I'm not always strong
Oh I need you here

Hear me I'm crying out
I'm ready now
Turn my world upside down
Find me
I'm lost inside the crowd
It's getting loud
I need you to see
I'm screaming for you to please
Hear me

Are you listening?
I'm restless and wild
I fall but I try
I need someone to understand
(Can you hear me?)
I'm lost in my thoughts
And baby I've fought
For all that I've got
Can you hear me?

Hear me I'm crying out
I'm ready now
Turn my world upside down
Find me
I'm lost inside this crowd
It's getting loud
I need you to see
I'm screaming for you to please
Hear me


He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme, I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold
If I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
It just ain't right, it just ain't right

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight, hold on tight

Oh 'cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy, hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
Waiting so long
So long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends, he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take

Oh 'cause I don't know
Don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster

Oh oh...beautiful
Oh oh...beautiful disaster


I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell by the flames that burned your words?

I never read your letter cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer. Try to make it all okay

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you, you'll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter, you couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer, repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never!

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
I never will
I never will
Never again


We're going crazy
Running on empty
You can't make up your mind
You tried to hide but
But you had to say it
Restless all this time
So, completely drained from everything that's in your life
It's so wrong but you had to scream every thought you kept inside

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back
And you love and you hate and you wait
One minute goes fast

You just can't escape it
You're losing your patience
You wondered what went wrong
Everything changes
Happy then jaded
Always a different song
Playing in your head
Just when you think you got it down
Out of nowhere
You realize it's different music playing now

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back
And you love and you hate and you wait
One minute goes fast

One minute goes fast...One minute goes fast...One minute goes fast

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back
And you love and you hate and you wait
One minute goes fast


Tired 
Of everything around me
I smile 
But I don't feel a thing no

I'm so far from where I need to be 
I've given up on faith, on everything 
All I want, all I need
Is some peace

There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so cold 
Slowly killing me

Secrets 
Eating at the core of me 
Shut off 
Trusting all the lies I breathe

I'm so far from where I need to be 
I've given up on faith, on everything 
All I wanted, all I needed
Was some peace

There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so damn cold 
Slowly killing me

Sinking ever so slowly
So far from where I should be
No hands reaching out for me
Help me, help me

Something's gone
I can feel it
It's all wrong
I'm so sick of this

There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so cold
Slowly killing me
There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so damn cold 
Slowly killing me


And I don't know, this could break my heart or save me 
Nothing's real until you let go completely 
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving 
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me 

Three months and I'm still sober 
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers
But I know its never really over  

And I don't know I could crash and burn but maybe 
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me 
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna' get it right
No comparing, second-guessing, no, not this time

Three months and I'm still breathing 
Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in 
But I know it's never really over, no 

Wake... up 

Three months and I'm still standing here 
Three months and I'm getting better, yeah 
Three months and I still... mmm, oh

Three months and its still hard enough
Three months of living here without you now
Three months and three months I, oh...

Three months and I'm still breathing
Three months and I'm still remembering
Three months and wake... up

Three months and I'm still sober 
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers  


It's over, it's over, it's over…

It seems you can't hear me
When I open my mouth you never listen
You say stay, but what does that mean
Do you think I honestly want to be reminded forever

Don't waste your time trying to fix
What I want to erase
What I need to forget
Don't waste your time on me my friend
Friend, what does that even mean
I don't want your hand
You'll only pull me down
So save your breath
Don't waste your song
On me, on me
Don't waste your time 

It's not easy not answering
Every time I want to talk to you
But I can't 
If you only knew the hell I put myself through
Replaying memories in my head of you and I 
Every night 

Don't waste your time trying to fix
What I want to erase
What I need to forget
Don't waste your time on me my friend
Friend, what does that even mean
I don't want your hand
You'll only pull me down
So save your breath
Don't waste your song
On me, on me
Don't waste your time 

You're callin'
You're talkin'
You're tryin'
Tryin' to get in
But it's over, it's over, it's over
Friend

Don't waste your time trying to fix it
So save your breath, don't waste your song
On me, on me
Don't waste your time

You held me
You felt me
You left me
But it's over, it's over, it's over
You touched me
You had me
But it's over, it's over, it's over my friend
Don't waste my time 


The only one who took you in
The only one who held your hand
Defended you against the others
Had your back on everything
Never let you down
You turned around betrayed your only brother

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?

I didn't know, I didn't know
I couldn't see, I couldn't see
Never thought you'd forget me
Couldn't believe, couldn't believe
How you deceived, you deceived
I never thought you'd do that to me

I will never be like you
I'll never do the things you do 
Selfish and lonely, what's your problem
Letting go of you and this
Is harder than I thought but I will not be poisoned by your actions

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?

I didn't know, I didn't know
I couldn't see, I couldn't see
Never thought you'd forget me
Couldn't believe, couldn't believe
How you deceived, you deceived
I never thought you'd do that to me 

Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?
Down, you let me down


Louder, louder
The voices in my head
Whispers taunting
All the things you said
Faster the days go by and I'm still
Stuck in this moment of wanting you here
Time
In the blink of an eye
You held my hand, you held me tight
Now you're gone
And I'm still crying
Shocked, broken
I'm dying inside

Where are you?
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Shadows linger
Only to my eye
I see you, I feel you
Don't leave my side
It's not fair
Just when I found my world
They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart

I miss you, you hurt me
You left with a smile
Mistaken, your sadness
Was hiding inside
Now all that's left
Are the pieces to find
The mystery you kept
The soul behind a guise

Where are you
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Why did you go?
All these questions run through my mind
I wish I couldn't feel at all
Let me be numb
I'm starting to fall

Where are you?
I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me
Be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me

Where are you?
Where are you?

You were smiling 


Far away from it all
You and me with no one else around
A brand new start is all we need
It's all we need to mend these hearts
Back to the beginning

Be still
Let it go

Before we lost hope
When we still touched and love wasn't so hard

Be still
I already know

Foolish one with the smile
You don't have to be brave
Every time we fall down
But we're falling from grace
I'll gladly climb your walls
If you'll meet me halfway

Slow, slow it down
Why do we run, we're missing so much, babe
Just lay in my arms for a while and

Be still
We should've known

Foolish one with the smile
You don't have to be brave
I'll gladly climb your walls
If you'll meet me halfway

Every time we fall down
But we're falling from grace
Here's my hand and my heart
It's yours to take

Be still
Be still now
Be still

Be still
Be still


I'm strong
But I break
I'm stubborn
And I make plenty of mistakes
Yeah I'm hard
And life with me is never easy
To figure out, to love 
I'm jaded but oh so lovely
All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be 
If you'll trust me, love me, let me
Maybe, maybe

Someday 
When we're at the same place
When we're on the same road
When it's okay to hold my hand
Without feeling lost
Without all the excuses
When it's just because you love me, you let me, you need me
Then maybe, maybe
All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be 
If you'll trust me, love me, let me
Maybe, maybe

I'm confusing as hell
I'm north and south
And I'll probably never have it all figured out
But what I know is I wasn't meant to walk this world without you
And I promise I'll try
Yeah I'm gonna try to give you every little part of me
Every single detail you missed with your eyes
Then maybe
Maybe, yeah maybe

One day
We'll meet again and you'll need me, you'll see me completely
Every little bit
Oh yeah maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then

I don't want to be tough
And I don't want to be proud
I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found
I'm not lost 
I need to be loved
I just need to be loved
I just want to be loved by you and I won't stop ‘cause I believe
That maybe, yeah maybe
Maybe, yeah maybe

I should know better than to touch the fire twice
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah maybe you might

Maybe, love maybe


Looks like I made a mess again
Heartbreak everywhere I step
This fire is getting hot again
But I touch the flame ‘cause I'm a curious cat
Creeping where I don't belong
Finding out what I knew all along
Crying all alone
And it's all my fault, all my fault

Yeah, I did it again...again

Oh, I'm getting tired of believing 
Even sicker of pretending
That it's not so bad, just wait it out 
Oh, I think you're feeding me lies again 
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now so just let me be
Let me be

It seems every time I find a good man
He's got a good little wife
I'm not jealous but I won't lie
I don't want to hear about your wonderful life
And babies everywhere I look
Trophy wives with their little black books
At this rate I'm gonna end up alone
It's probably all my fault, all my fault

Oh, another dead end...again

Oh, I'm getting tired of believing 
Even sicker of pretending
That it's not so bad, just wait it out
Oh, I think you're feeding me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now 

Bitter pill that I've swallowed
Just how low can my heart sink
Fairy tales from so long ago
Save them for someone that's not smart enough to know

‘Cause I, I'm getting tired of believing 
I'm through pretending
Yeah I'm broken and sad so I'll sit this one out
Oh I think you're feeding me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now

How I feel right now
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
Let me be
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
Let me be


Lay back, enjoy the fall lover I won't hurt you
I take it all on if you trust me
Don't hesitate let it go, let me know, baby show me
I don't read minds but I'm trying my best to read yours

Yeah
Let me know, let me know
Yeah
Let me know, it's all for you

Help me help yourself
I want to give it all to you but
Don't make me second guess, I don't want to play games no more
For sure I've got your back, I've never wanted anything more than you and your sexy smile
I love you so try not to blow it this time

Yeah
Let me know, let me know
Yeah
Let me know, it's all for you

Everything inside you, about you
I want to know, taste, hold, love you anytime I want to
Let me show you, let me give you everything I have saved just for you
I know you love me but I'm gonna need more than what you're giving me
I want to feel you but I feel empty
You gotta help me, you gotta meet me halfway
There I see you, can you see me, closer now
Just tell me, show me, what it's gonna take to get you to trust me, love me like I know you can

Yeah
Let me know, let me know
Yeah
Let me know, it's all for you


Excuse me for this
I just want a kiss
I just want to know what it feels like to touch
Something so pure
Something I'm so sure of 
What it feels like to stand outside your door
I'm unworthy
I can see you're above me
But I can be lovely given the chance

Don't move
I want to remember you just like this
Don't move
It's only a breath or two between our lips

I know why you left
I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you
I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever
But I'm working on it
If I can't hold you 
Can I give you a kiss
Can I have a kiss

I see that you're torn
I've got some scars of my own
Seems I want what I know is gonna leave me hungry

Don't move
I need to remember you just like this

I know why you left

I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you
I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever
But I'm working on it
If I can't hold you 
Can I give you a kiss
Can I

All I have
All I can give to you I will
Just promise this
If I can't have forever
Can I have a kiss

I know why you left
I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you
I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever 
But I'm working on it
If I can't hold you
Can I give you a kiss
Can I give you a kiss
Can I, can I
Can I have a kiss


Are you there?
Are you watching me?
As I lie here on this floor
They say you feel what I do
They say you're here every moment
Will you stay? 
Stay ‘till the darkness leaves
Stay here with me
I know you're busy, I know I'm just one
But you might be the only one who sees me
The only one to save me

Why is it so hard?
Why can't you just take me?
I don't have much to go 
Before I fade completely

Can you feel how cold I am?
Do you cry as I do?
Are you lonely up there all by yourself?
Like I have felt all my life
The only one to save mine

How are you so strong?
What's it like to feel so free?
Your heart is really something 
Your love, a complete mystery to me

Are you there watching me?
As I lie here on this floor
Do you cry, do you cry with me?
Cry with me tonight 

Are you there? 
Are you watching me?


I've been thinkin'
How you're wastin'
All that lovin' on someone else
I can't take it
I will make you
Forget all about the one i'll be replacin'
So just say it
I know you been thinkin' bout it
I see you look around
I will give you
What you're missin'
What you see in me when you think no one's watchin'

Don't wait too long
I'm not that strong
I can't hold on...
Much longer

Oh (don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh (don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You don't touch
You don't talk
You don't look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

Oh yeah, yeah

I don't care
What they say
I'll deal with anythin
If it gets you next to me
I don't want
Just a taste
I want you anytime I feel a little craving
I'm not that strong
I can't hold on

Oh (don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh (don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

What are you hiding in your covers?
Like to wait, little lover
What will you do when they discover your eyes on another?
Why you runnin' round in circles
Tryin' so hard to discourage
Tellin' secrets that'll surface
One way or another

Oh, I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh, Oh, I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
You never touch
You never talk to me
You never look me in the face

Your dirty little secret
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty, dirty secret
Na, na, na, na
Dirty
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell by the flames that burned your words?

I never read your letter cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer. Try to make it all okay

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you, you'll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter, you couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer, repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never!

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?

I never will
I never will

Everybody says you're no good for me
Nothin' but trouble is what you bring
Everybody thinks you're out to get me
Helpless little fool they must think I am
Everybody thinks that we're both crazy
Well it's just my luck

Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I...
I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts
My ways
I guess not today

Everybody says I'm no good for you
Nothin' but trouble is what I bring
Everybody thinks I'm out to get you
Well it's just my luck

Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I...
I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted heart
My ways
I guess not today

You look like a mess
I'd like to know
How 'bout movin' just a little closer
I think maybe one day I...
I could love you

Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I...
I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts
My ways
I guess not today
Not today
I guess not...
Today
Not today
Not today


You're not worth it babe
The trouble you bring, the noise you keep
And you don't even care, yeah

I'm so sick of you babe
Nights wasted, I'm through faking
You don't turn me on
You don't do anything at all

Baby I can't stand the sight of your face
Baby I don't even want to hear your name

Don't know what I saw
But I ain't seeing it now
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth

Guess I fell too fast
Guess I learned my lesson
So much for true love
I'll take the Chivas instead, yeah
I'll take the Chicas instead, oh yeah

You're too high maintenance babe
All the time you spend trying to fit in 
And no one even cares, yeah
It's so ridiculous babe
Watching you turn as I burn
It's like you're not even there, yeah

Baby don't you try and hold my hand
Maybe you should keep your eyes on your new girlfriend

Don't know what I saw 
But I ain't seeing it now
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth
Guess I fell too fast 
Guess I learned my lesson
So much for true love
I'll take the Chivas instead
Oh, I'll take the Chivas instead
Of your bed

It wasn't even good
Trust me
I must have been so so so so lonely
You are crap, yeah
You should keep your eyes on your new little brat
Yeah, it's hard not to look, I know
I'm ama-zazing
I love you Chivas.



Running around
Trying to figure out, now
Where you put your smile down
You can't let them see you like this
Thinking what mask you're gonna front
You grab the nearest one
You take your place

Amongst these faceless others
Underneath the surface
Everything's so backwards
It's all a lie

Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Don't move
Sit there in a trance
Do not make a sound
Fool, what were you thinking?
Fallen no one's gonna call
No hands were up at all
You're on your own again

Walls are closing in
You can't feel anything
Becoming one of them
Come back to me

Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Fading, fading, fading
Fading, fading, fading

Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading away

Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Fading, fading... 


Guess this means you're sorry, you're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back, all you said before
Like how much you wanted, anyone but me
Said you'd never come back, but here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Maybe I was stupid, for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for, trying to pick a fight

I know that I've got issues, but you're pretty messed up too
Either way I've found out, I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Being with you, is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you, but I can't let you go, oh yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you


Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead

This may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with the snap of your finger, oh no

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out


If anyone asks
I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk

Whenever I see you
I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry? cry?

If anyone asks
I'll tell them we just grew apart
Yeah, what do I care
If they believe me or not ''(if they believe me or not)''

Whenever I feel
Your memory is breakin' my heart
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry? cry?

I'm talkin' in circles
I'm lyin', they know it
Why won't this just all go away?

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry? Cry?


I used to be a little bit shy
I kept my deepest feelings inside
Speaking up to you about my
Emotions has always been hard

But this just can't wait
Tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I won't let one more day
Pass without you explaining what we are

This is gonna sound kind of silly
But I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me
You kept both eyes open

Baby, can you tell me what does that mean?
If you're lookin' over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me, it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you

A lot of things I can take
Got a high threshold for pain
But let's get one thing straight
I'm not down to share you with anyone

If this not what you're lookin' for
Nice knowing you, but there's the door
'Cause I know that I can find someone
Who'll give me what I want

This is gonna sound kind of silly
If you're lookin' over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you

Even if I end up broken hearted
I won't lie
I don't wanna hear goodbye
But either way I'll be alright

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave ''(Don't let me stop you)''
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
''(Don't let me, don't let me)''
No, don't let me stop you


Tear up the photographs
But yesterday won't let go
Everyday, everyday, every minute

Here comes the emptiness
Just can't leave lonely alone
Everyday, everyday, hey hey

This second chance is really gettin' me down
You give and take in everything I dreamed about
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to
Get over you

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between 
To escape this desperate scene

Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby 'cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you

I'd rather walk alone
Don't wanna chase you around
Everyday, everyday, every minute

I'd fall a thousand times
'Fore I let you drag me down
Everyday, everyday, hey hey

Your new beginning was a perfect ending
But I keep feeling we've already been here before
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to
Get over you

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between 
To escape this desperate scene

Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby 'cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you

Tell me with so many out there
Why I always turn to you
Your goodbyes tear me down every time
And it's so easy to see
That the blame is on me

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to
Get over you

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between 
To escape this desperate scene

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to
Get over you

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in between
To escape this desperate scene

Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby 'cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you


Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you
Now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough
To let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

''(Already gone, already gone, already gone)'' ooh woah
Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone


Hearts break too fast when they're sentimental
Won't stay, won't last when it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions blinded by your spotlight?

Can't breath, can't sleep, it's the medication
I've kissed goodbye to my reservations
I know there's other fish out in the sea
Not for me, I want you

If I can't have you, then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I cant have you then all the damage has been done, baby

You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''

Heartbreak, cold sweat, think I'm slipping under
Can't fight, no threat 'cause there is just no use
One look, no hesitation
I'm slipping into you

Forgive those eyes, these lips just taste it
No time to waste on an invitation
My shame, my self control has suffered enough
And everybody wants to be loved

If I can't have you, then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I cant have you then all the damage has been done, baby

You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''

I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer
They say perfection's always right around the corner
Could be true, but if I can't have you

If I can't have you, then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I cant have you then all the damage has been done, baby

You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''

Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you


I can tell, I can tell how much you hate this
And deep down inside, you know it's killing me
I can call, wish you well and try to change this
But nothing I can say will change anything

Where were my senses?
I left them all behind
Why did I turn away, away?

I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Didn't mean, didn't mean to leave you stranded
Went away 'cause I didn't wanna face the truth
Reaching out, reach for me, empty-handed
You don't know if I care, you tryin' to find the proof

There were times I'd wonder
Could I have eased your pain?
Why did I turn away, away?

I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright ''(save you)''
It's gonna be alright ''(I wish I could save you)''

We can pretend nothing's changed
Pretend it's all the same
And there will be no pain tonight

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright ''(save you)''
It's gonna be alright ''(I wish I could save you)''

I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright ''(save you)''
It's gonna be alright ''(I wish I could save you)''
It's gonna be alright


This situation
If it gets any deeper could be critical
I'm not your love monkey
So be taking back all the lies you sold

What did you want me to be, yeah?
It's just too much now
So tell me, so tell me, so tell me
One, two, three, four

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you?
Why must you keep me underground?
Tell me, tell me, whyyawannabringmedown?

Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you 110?
Don't blink 'cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me, whyyawannabringmedown?

Now your transmission is on the negative
You're on a losing streak
This information is getting ordinary
And you're losing me

What's with your hostility
Oh when the light's on me?
Well you're down to the last chance
So tell me, so tell me
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you?
Why must you keep me underground?
Tell me, tell me, whyyawannabringmedown?

Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you 110?
Don't blink 'cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me, whyyawannabringmedown?

Oh ''(Bring me down)''
''(Bring me down)'' Ooh yeah

Ooh, was it all just a waste of time
Well, I don't wanna spend my whole life thinkin' 'bout it
Baby, this is where I draw the line
I think I'm done, Somebody!

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you?
Why must you keep me underground?
Tell me, tell me, whyyawannabringmedown?

Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you 110?
Don't blink 'cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me, whyyawannabringmedown?

Down, yeah
Whyyawannabringmedown, oh yeah
Tell me, tell me whyyawannabringmedown?
Down, down, whyyawannabringmedown?
Huh, whyyawanna, whyyawanna
Whyyawannabringmedown?


Ahh, ahh, ahh

I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said good morning
I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming

So now I’ll take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don’t think we saw it coming
It’s all adding up to something
That asks for some involvement
That asks for our commitment
I think I see it coming
If we step out on that limb

My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why’s everything got to be so intense with me
I’m trying to handle all this unpredictability
And our probability

It’s a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I’ll regret it
It’s a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take a long shot

I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We’ll never see 'em coming
Throw caution to the wind and
We’ll see which way it's blowing
And to this fully knowing 
We’ll never see it coming
'Til it's much to close to stop

My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why’s everything got to be so intense with me
I’m trying to handle all this unpredictability
And our probability

It’s a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it
I know that I’ll regret it
It’s a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot

Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming
But we'll make it

It’s a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it
I know that I’ll regret it
It’s a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
No chance
'Cause you're the best I got

It’s a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it
I know that I’ll regret it
So take a long shot
It’s a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it

It’s a long shot but I say why not
You never saw me comin'
If I say forget it
I know that I’ll regret it
It’s a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it 


So woke up and thought I’d try
Try to step across the line
You know that I been thinking bout it for a while
Yeah

It’s time to think it’s time I knew
Does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain, it’s really possible
You say

Can’t change the winter say
Won’t matter anyway
Can’t reach that far 'cause it’s impossible
''(It’s impossible)''

Can’t rise above this place
Won’t change them all so I’ll be
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
''(Impossible)''

Walking by myself I know
This lonely road’s becoming my new home
But I don’t stop, I just keep moving on
And on

Ain’t no need to dry my eyes
I haven’t cried in quite some time
Every day I find that you know it’s possible
You say

Can’t change the winter say
Won’t matter anyway
Can’t reach that far 'cause it’s impossible
''(It’s impossible)''

Can’t rise above this place
Won’t change them all so I’ll be
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
''(Impossible)''

Someone tell me why you’re so hard taking chances
You draw the line to think that I won’t ask for more, yeah
I will stumble and I make my own mistakes, yeah
But I won’t worry 'bout it anymore, it’s impossible

Can’t change the winter say
Won’t matter anyway
Can’t reach that far 'cause it’s impossible
''(It’s impossible)''

Can’t rise above this place
Won’t change them all so I’ll be
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
''(Impossible)''

It’s impossible to you
Not impossible to me
Not impossible for me

Can’t rise above this place
Won’t change them all so I’ll be
Breaking down the walls ''(not impossible for me)''
To the impossible

So woke up and thought I’d try
Try to step across the line


Frozen forgetful again
The part where I lose my head
The scene where I’m supposed to speak
But instead

I sit and listen again
I’m stuck with these cards I guess

Leaping from this cliff in my thoughts
I fly like the stones in my heart
Drowning in doubt for what reason

I sit so patiently
Drenched in what you want me to be
I can’t escape

I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Come get me

Fearless with cape in hand
Conquer what I need to do mend
Little girls get so broken

But I sit so patiently
Drenched in what you want me to be
I can’t see no escape

I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Come get me

Through with golden roads and perfect love
Too much of your mouth is like too much sun
How I burn, how I burn
I was so patient waiting for my turn

I fly like stone
As I break every bone
''Come get me''

I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Come get me

I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Oh, I’m ready now
Come get me


Hot temper with the shortest fuse, you're
Such a mess with an attitude, you
Workin' hard, but you're payin' more, you
Never talk cuz you don't have to, you

Got a job, but you hate the man who
Takes it all like Uncle Sam
I want you, you, you
You you you-you
I-I-I, I-I want you

Out of gas, so you walk for miles to
Pick me up in your worn-out shoes, you
Never settle, never take too much, you
Count on me just like I count on you

Kiss me, like when I first saw you
Figured out, couldn't be without you
You, you, you
You, you, you-you
I-I, I-I-I, I-I want you
I want you, you, you
You-you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want you

No one else will do, I want
No one makes me smile, I want
No one gets me how, I want
No one else is you, you, you

I want you, you, you
You-you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want you
I want you, you, you
You-you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want you

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

You're so hot-tempered
With the shortest fuse
You're such a mess
And with an attitude

You, you, you
You, you, you-you
I-I, I-I-I, I-I want you
I want you, you, you
You-you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want
I want I want I want

No one else will do, I want
No one makes me smile, I want
No one gets me how, I want
No one else is you, you, you

I want you, you, you
You-you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want you
I want you, you, you
You-you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want you
I-I want you

You and me walkin' together
Screwin' up for worse or for better
You, you, you
You you you-you
I-I-I, I-I, I-I want you


Maybe no one told you there is strength in your tears
And so you fight to keep from pouring out
But what if you unlock the gate that keeps your secrets so?
Do you think that there's enough you might drown?

If no one will listen if you decide to speak
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you for what you really are
I will be here still

No one can tell you where you alone must go
There's no telling what you'll find there
And God, I know the feeling eats away at your bones
Screaming every step to stay here

If no one will listen if you decide to speak
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you for what you really are
I will be here still

If you find your fists are all red from beating yourself down
If your legs have given out under the weight
If you find that you've been settling for a world of gray
So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate

If no one will listen if you decide to speak
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you for what you really are
I will be here still

If no one will listen if you decide to speak
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you for what you really are
I will be here still

I will be here still


Never saw ''"I Love You"'' as a trend
'Cause I don't really work like that 
I mean what I say when it levaes my lips, oh

Nothin' you could say would change my heart
'Cause I don't really work like that
If you'd only let me in I'd show ya
But I'm tired of workin' so hard

You keep pushin' me away
Tearin' down your walls
Is forcing me to break
Don't know what to say

Will you ever let me in?
It's hard for me to pretend
So tell me what you wanna do

Tell me is there any other way
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Tell me there's a reason to stay
'Cause I'm about to get up and run

Better think about the words you say
If you don't wanna end up alone 
Tell me is there any room for me
'Cause when it's all said and done babe
I'm tired of singin', oh

Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my ...

Never confuse me with where you've been
'Cause I don't really work like that
If I'm holdin you then I'm all in

I know you're scared, yeah you've been burned
But I won't ever hurt you like that
If you'd take a chance I'm not like them, them, them

Give and get nothin' in return
You don't seem to care 
You're not the only one who hurts

Tell me is there any other way
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Tell me there's a rason to stay
Cause I'm about to get up and run

Better Think about the words you say
If you don't wanna end up alone
Tell me is there any room for me
'Cause when it's all said and done babe
I'm tired of singin', oh

Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my ...

Why ya gotta pull away
Pull away and leave me hangin'
Why ya gotta make me say
Don't make me say what you've been thinkin' all along, oh

Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I'm about to get up and run

Tell me is there any other way
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Tell me there's a rason to say
'Cause I'm about to get up and run

Better think about the words you say
If you don't wanna end up alone
Tell me is there any room for me
'Cause when it's all said and done babe
I'm tired of singin', oh

Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, goodbye's on the tip of my ...


So, oh, uh, ooh

What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?

Tell me what’s this desperation
'Cause I don’t recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
It’s more than I could take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part, p-part, part)

Now everything is coming under
'Cause you were the chance I can’t afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart, oh

I must admit the grass is so much greener
On the other side
Since you left I noticed now you’re so much meaner
And it’s something I think I like

Tell me what’s this desperation
'Cause I don’t recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart, heart, heart, heart)
It’s more than I could take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part, part, part)

Now everything is coming under
'Cause you were the chance I can’t afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart

I made a bad mistake
Used to pray for sins
Drowning you one more time
And mend my wicked ways

'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day, the day I broke your heart (heart, heart, h-heart, heart)
It’s more than I could take
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart (part, part, p-part, part)

Now everything is coming under ''(coming under)''
'Cause you were the chance I can’t afford to waste
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
The day we fell apart, oh

Uh, oh, ooh yeah


You're complicating things
I need some room to breathe
I gotta get back to simplicity
If you want more than this
Then tell me what it is I gotta do
Oh, this is killin' me

I need you to see
That something's gotta change

Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Back to the butterflies
Starin deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be
When livin' and lovin' was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back to the way we used to be?

When did we mess it up
What happened to love
We had it good, but it wasnt enough
We shouldnt let it fade all the way
Were over-thinkin' this way too much

I want you next to me
But somethins gotta change

Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Back to the butterflies
Starin' deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be?
When livin and lovin was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back to the way we used to be?

''(Can we go back?)
(Can we go back to the way we used to be?)
(Can we go back?)''

Oh, I'm getting tired of the fight
We can't pretend that it's alright
I'm slowly losing hope
Baby can we try

Can we go back to the way we used to be
Back to the butterflies
Starin deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be
When livin and lovin was easy

We gotta find a way to fool reality
''(Can we go back?)''
We gotta find a way to fool reality
''(Can we go back?)''
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back to the way we used to be?

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over
With someone new
They told you I was moving on
Over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swingin'
You try to break me
But you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the brokenhearted
Thanks to you, I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
When I'm alone


There's a place that I know
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone
If I show it to you now
Will it make you run away?

Or will you stay, even if it hurts?
Even if I try to push you out, will you return?
And remind me who I really am
Please remind me who I really am

Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me, even with my dark side?

Like a diamond from black dust
It's hard to know what can become if you give up
So don't give up on me
Please remind me who I really am

Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me, even with my dark side?

Don't run away, don't run away
Just tell me that you will stay
Promise me you will stay
Don't run away, don't run away
Just promise me you will stay
Promise me you will stay

Will you love me? Ohh
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me, even with my dark side?

Don't run away, don't run away
Don't run away, promise you'll stay


Could you love somebody like that?
Could you attract someone like that?
Could you go where people can see someone like me?
Could you do that?

Would you face me? Make me
Listen to the truth even if it breaks me?
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly

All I see are Stepford-like lives
Needles and knives, beautiful lies
Bringing out the green in your eyes
Perfect disguise for envy and pride

Face me, make me
Listen to the truth even if it breaks me
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly

You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me

Face me, make me
Listen to the truth even if it breaks me
You can judge me, love me
If you’re hating me

Would you face me? Make me
Listen to the truth even if it breaks me?
Judge me, love me
If you’re hating me, do it honestly
Honestly, honestly, honestly

You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me

You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me


Thick skin, soft touch
Heart of gold but it's n-n-n-not enough
Forgiving arms, the higher road
Working hard but it's n-n-n-not enough

You said, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough
But what you really mean
Is you're not good enough, you're not good enough
You can't deliver so you turn it around

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
But that I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

A strong hold, a fun ride
But rollercoasters are just n-n-n-not enough
I keep it in, you wear me out
This kind of love is n-n-n-not enough

You said I’m just a sinking ship, I’m just a sinking ship
But what that really means
Is you can’t handle this, you can’t handle this
You couldn’t win so you turn it around

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
But that I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

Your love feels different
It’s like a blow to the head with your compliments
Your love hurts deeper
It’s like a brick in the sea and I’m drowning with it

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
But that I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

So understand it means nothing when you say you love me
When you say you love me
When you say you love me, you love me, you love me

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
You know the truth is that you're not good enough
You're not good enough


Ooh, simply math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone

I didn't get it the first time
But don't think I fell so blind
And I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

Even had the nerve to flirt with her
In front of my face
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes
And now get out of my place

You say I'm crazy and that we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me? Oh yeah

I didn't get it the first time
But don't think I feel so blind
But I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

All of your promises plus
A thousand apologies just
Take out the pain and then it leaves us
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all

You can stop wasting my time
Without you I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure out?
Dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you, yeah

I didn't get it the first time
But don't think I feel so blind
Yeah, I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you

Simply math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time, I'm going out of my mind
And I may not be Einstein
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you


You say it's easier
Alone and undisturbed
You said yes and danced before
And got your feelings hurt

You say most days you're good
It's not so bad, this room
Watching the rain today
Even though it's clear and sunny

And you fight it so hard
How to tell if it's real or not

Take a breath and listen ''(listen)''
Open up stop wishing ''(wishing)''
All that you've been missing ''(missing)''
Standing in front of you

Everything you're fearing ''(fearing)''
All the walls are building ''(building)''
Take a chance, your reason ''(reason)''
Standing in front of you

Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you

You start to sway again
Feeling good in your skin
You start to remember when
You didn't have to try, and then

The glitter turns to dust
The color fades enough
To make out pictures of a fire
That burns like love

You can close your eyes, don't worry
I'll still be here in the morning

Take a breath and listen ''(listen)''
Open up stop wishing ''(wishing)''
All that you've been missing ''(missing)''
Standing in front of you

Everything you're fearing ''(fearing)''
All the walls are building ''(building)''
Take a chance, your reason ''(reason)''
Standing in front of you

Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you

And they won't break us
And they can't get through
'Cause I'm gonna be here
Standing in front of you

Take a breath and listen ''(listen)''
Open up stop wishing ''(wishing)''
All that you've been missing ''(missing)''
Standing in front of you

Everything you're fearing ''(fearing)''
All the walls are building ''(building)''
Take a chance, your reason ''(reason)''
Standing in front of you

Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you


I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again

'Cause the lights are on
But I'm never home
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude
'Cause I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling upon us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again
If I hate you, what does that do
So I breathe in and I count to ten

'Cause the lights are on
And I'm coming home
Yes I am back with a new heart in my hand
'Cause I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you
For every time that I cried
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me
That's alright, yeah I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And, and I forgive you


Yes I stumbled into the night
We're touching but I feel like you are still out of reach
The people here are buzzing like a bug on a light
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me

Sentimental feelings
Never get me anywhere
My heart concern is bleeding
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone, no

Coming through this desert of stone
These faces on the statues that I used to know
Wishing I was more than what my story has told
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening

Gotta keep it all together
Longin' for a hand to hold
Keep clear of the shadows
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone, no

Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know
Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone
Yeah, ooh yeah

Hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone

Hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone


I watch the days rush by me like a river
I shouldn't wait, but I'm scared to touch the water
I let the phone ring, why won't you believe me
I wait for silence, takes a lot not to answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you don't deserve me and you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
''(The war is over)'' But the war is over ''(The war is over)''
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure
''(The war is over)'' 'Cause the war is over

I used to let you paint a pretty picture
You got me caught up with your ''"you're my girl forever"''
So I forgive you, it felt good when you hold me
Yeah, you owned me, now you wish you had really known me

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you'll only hurt me and you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
''(The war is over)'' But the war is over ''(the war is over)''
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure ''(the war is over)''

This is not my surrender
I'm not running for cover
I'm right here, I know you see me
But your words no longer defeat me

In the night, when you're lonely
You remember how much you miss me
So you call, but I swear
You can try a million times, you'll get the same answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away, 'cause you'll only hurt me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
''(The war is over)'' But the war is over ''(the war is over)''
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over


I think I might be a fortune teller
I read your face just like a letter
The funny thing about forever
Is it comes with a side of never never

I can't buy into what you're selling
And no it's not that I don't want it
Believe me I love to close my eyes, enjoy the ride
But you reek of indecision and I

I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out

You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down
Let me down, oh

I am too smart to let you in here
But I'm just dumb enough to linger
I wanna think that you'll be different
Smoking mirrors are so clever, clever

I picked him and things went so bad
Then what you say won't actually happen
I've been dying to open my eyes
See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry

''I know, I know, I know''

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out

You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down
Let me down, oh

I need to be there when you say you're gonna be
I care too much and you care enough to leave
I want some place to rest my head without waiting
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair
It's not fair to me, 'cause I know by now

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out

You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down
Let me down, let me down

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out

You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down
Let me down, oh


If you go, they'll say your following
If you don't, then your too good for them
If you smile, you must be ignorant
If you don't, what's your problem?

If you're down, so ungrateful
And if you're happy, why so selfish?
And you can't win, no
You cant win, no

The one who doesn't quit fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster

Everytime you try to fly
You end up fallin' out of line
Oh you can't, you can't win, no

If you're thin, call it a walkin' disease
If you're not, there all screamin' ''"obese"''
If you're straight, why aren't you married yet?
If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?

If it's wrong, you'll never hit
If it's right, you'll always miss
You can't win, no
You can't win, no

The one who doesn't quit fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster

Everytime you try to fly
You end up fallin' out of line
Oh you can't, you can't win, no

And you try, you try so hard
But I swear it on your heart
'Cause you play you play the game
But you pay you pay for it
You can't win, no
You can't win, no

If you speak, you'll only piss them off
If you don't, you're another robot
If you stop, they'll just say you quit
If you don't, you might lose your sh..

You cant win, no
You cant win, no
You cant win, no

The one who doesn't quit fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster

Everytime you try to fly
You end up fallin' out of line
Oh you can't, you can't win, no ''(can't win)''

The one who doesn't quit fit in
Underdressed under your skin
Oh, a walking disaster

Everytime you try to fly
You end up fallin' out of line
Oh you can't, you can't win, no ''(can't win)''

You can't, you can't you can't win, no
You can't, you can't you can't win, no
You can't, you can't you can't win, no


Shaking your head like it's all wrong
Before you're here you're already gone
And even with the light all around you
You're all alone in the dark

You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down a lonely road
You say it's just want love
But when it's close enough you just let it go

The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start
Breaking your own heart

Too many tears, too many falls
It's easy here behind these walls
But you don't have to walk in the shadows
Life is so hard

You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down a lonely road
You say it's just want love
But when it's close enough you just let it go

The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start
Breaking your own heart

It's not too late, I'm still right here
If only you let go of your fears

You're breaking your heart
Taking your own heart down the lonely road
You say it's just want love
But when it's close enough you just let it go

The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start
Breaking your own heart
You're breaking your own heart


When we're driving in your car
It's like I'm on my own, yeah
I can't ask you how you are
You're always on the phone, yeah
And when we kiss I feel so empty
I really wish you knew what's been on my mind
You're gonna miss me, so get ready
I'm about to tell you why

Cause when I'm with you I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, woah
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah oh

When you look me in the eye
It's like you're far away, yeah
Some pretty legs go walking by
Your gaze is wandering, yeah
It's such a shame that you don't notice
The way that everybody's looking at me
Get off the train
This love is hopeless
Feeling like I'm gonna sink

Cause when I'm with you I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, woah
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah oh

But here's something you don't know about me
When you pushed me out
I found something better, you'll see
While you were paying no attention to me
I found somebody who can treat me right

When I'm with him I'm not alone
It gets better everyday
I hope you know, oh
I'm not alone
And it's never gonna change
I hope you know

When I'm with you I'm alone
No matter what you say
I hope you know, woah
That I'm alone
You say you're gonna change
But I know you won't, woah oh

I'm not alone
I'm not alone


I can see the weight there in your eyes
I can feel the thorn in your side
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing flight
One way down a dead end street
Broken glass underneath your feet
You think the day won't break this endless night

The sun will rise
The sun will rise
When you've lost your light
The sun will rise
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

I've been in stuck in a storm before
Felt the wind raging at my door
Couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't find a way out
Somehow my clouds disappeared
Somehow I made it here
Maybe just so you could hear me say

The sun will rise
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
When you've lost your light
The sun will rise
It'll be alright (It'll be alright)
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

Although you can't see it
So hard to believe it
Sometimes you just need a little faith (All you need is a little faith)
There's an answer to your prayer
And I swear that there'll come a day, yeah

The sun will rise
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
The sun will rise
Yeah
The sun will rise
The sun will rise

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

The sun will rise


Any chance you get to play the worn out pity card
Any opportunity to push my buttons hard
It's getting old, your 'poor me' thoughts
Believe me boy, when I say, "So what"

This broken record thing has got to stop
I'm losing interest in your pillow talk

And uuhuuhuuh it's not looking good
And uuhuuhuuh , I'm not in the mood
And uuhuuhuuh  I can't get through
To you uuhuuh uuhuuhuuh

Don't be a girl about it 'cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it, now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it

And uuhuuhuuh I'm sleeping with the enemy oh, oh
And uuhuuhuuh I'm counting sheep while you're in love
Now you're up in arms because I say we're not working out
You wonder if I loved you from the start, well, I tell you what

I knew a guy who changed my world
And then he grew to a little girl
This metamorphoses is just too much
You're crossing lines that I just can't let go of

And uuhuuhuuh it's not looking good
And uuhuuhuuh  I'm not in the mood
And uuhuuhuuh I can't get through
To you uuhuuh uuhuuhuuh

Don't be a girl about it 'cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it, now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it

And uuh, uuh, uuh, I'm sleeping with the enemy ohoh
And uuh, uuh, uuh, I'm counting sheep while you're in love

I guess it's true that love can grow in different directions
I chose the high road and you chose to be a girl
I know you're mad at me now and it's all my fault somehow
Here comes my favorite part, you're so misunderstood

And uuhuuhuuh it's not looking good
And uuhuuhuuh I'm not in the mood
And uuhuuhuuh yeah I'm so through
To you uuhuuh uuhuuhuuh
 
Don't be a girl about it 'cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it, now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it

And uuhuuhuuh I'm sleeping with the enemy oh, oh
And uuhuuhuuh I'm counting sheep while you're in love
Don't be a girl about it

'Cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it 'cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it and now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it, you're such a girl about it


I am a woman
Cut in two
By ambitious pride
Stuck in my ways
Between you and my other life

Now I have been around enough to know when love has ended
But I believe that you and I deserve to be extended

So why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
'Cause we both know
I can't stop myself

Our empty house
You occupy
When I'm far away
Heavier hearts won't justify
Why I'm gone today

Now I have hung a cloud above our lives from always leaving
Figured you would at least make me give a better reason

So why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
Because we both know
I can't stop myself

In the early mornings when I'm up before dawn
You say "why don't you stay" but you keep sleeping on
Maybe you're just used to me being gone
Cause if you know that I don't want to go

Then why don't you try
Oh yeah
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
'Cause we both know,
I can't stop myself

Why don't you
Why don't you try
When it's time to go, oh
'Cause I don't want to have to go
And be the one to leave you holding on alone
But this, this is my goodbye

So why don't you try
Oh oh, oh
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you try 


Yes I stumbled into the night
We're touching but I feel like you are still out of reach
The people here are buzzing like a bug on a light
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me

Sentimental feelings
Never get me anywhere
My heart concern is bleeding
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone, no

Coming through this desert of stone
These faces on the statues that I used to know
Wishing I was more than what my story has told
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening

Gotta keep it all together
Longin' for a hand to hold
Keep clear of the shadows
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone, no

Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know
Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone
Yeah, ooh yeah

Hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone

Hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone lets go of me
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone


I watch the days rush by me like a river
I shouldn't wait, but I'm scared to touch the water
I let the phone ring, why won't you believe me
I wait for silence, takes a lot not to answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you don't deserve me and you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
''(The war is over)'' But the war is over ''(The war is over)''
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure
''(The war is over)'' 'Cause the war is over

I used to let you paint a pretty picture
You got me caught up with your ''"you're my girl forever"''
So I forgive you, it felt good when you hold me
Yeah, you owned me, now you wish you had really known me

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you'll only hurt me and you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
''(The war is over)'' But the war is over ''(the war is over)''
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure ''(the war is over)''

This is not my surrender
I'm not running for cover
I'm right here, I know you see me
But your words no longer defeat me

In the night, when you're lonely
You remember how much you miss me
So you call, but I swear
You can try a million times, you'll get the same answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away, 'cause you'll only hurt me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
''(The war is over)'' But the war is over ''(the war is over)''
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over


Thick skin, soft touch
Heart of gold but it's n-n-n-not enough
Forgiving arms, the higher road
Working hard but it's n-n-n-not enough

You said, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough
But what you really mean
Is you're not good enough, you're not good enough
You can't deliver so you turn it around

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
But that I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

A strong hold, a fun ride
But rollercoasters are just n-n-n-not enough
I keep it in, you wear me out
This kind of love is n-n-n-not enough

You said I’m just a sinking ship, I’m just a sinking ship
But what that really means
Is you can’t handle this, you can’t handle this
You couldn’t win so you turn it around

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
But that I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

Your love feels different
It’s like a blow to the head with your compliments
Your love hurts deeper
It’s like a brick in the sea and I’m drowning with it

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
But that I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

So understand it means nothing when you say you love me
When you say you love me
When you say you love me, you love me, you love me

You didn't let me down
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes
While breaking my heart

You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me

You love me, you love me
You said you love me
You know the truth is that you're not good enough
You're not good enough


I can see the weight there in your eyes
I can feel the thorn in your side
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing flight
One way down a dead end street
Broken glass underneath your feet
You think the day won't break this endless night

The sun will rise
The sun will rise
When you've lost your light
The sun will rise
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

I've been in stuck in a storm before
Felt the wind raging at my door
Couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't find a way out
Somehow my clouds disappeared
Somehow I made it here
Maybe just so you could hear me say

The sun will rise
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
When you've lost your light
The sun will rise
It'll be alright (It'll be alright)
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

Although you can't see it
So hard to believe it
Sometimes you just need a little faith (All you need is a little faith)
There's an answer to your prayer
And I swear that there'll come a day, yeah

The sun will rise
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
The sun will rise (The sun will rise)
The sun will rise
Yeah
The sun will rise
The sun will rise

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

The sun will rise


Hearts break too fast when they're sentimental
Won't stay, won't last when it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions blinded by your spotlight?

Can't breath, can't sleep, it's the medication
I've kissed goodbye to my reservations
I know there's other fish out in the sea
Not for me, I want you

If I can't have you, then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I cant have you then all the damage has been done, baby

You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''

Heartbreak, cold sweat, think I'm slipping under
Can't fight, no threat 'cause there is just no use
One look, no hesitation
I'm slipping into you

Forgive those eyes, these lips just taste it
No time to waste on an invitation
My shame, my self control has suffered enough
And everybody wants to be loved

If I can't have you, then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I cant have you then all the damage has been done, baby

You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''

I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer
They say perfection's always right around the corner
Could be true, but if I can't have you

If I can't have you, then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I cant have you then all the damage has been done, baby

You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''
If I can't have you
''(If I can't have you)''

Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you


Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't


You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
But oh, they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could

I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
Cause I ain't never
No, I ain't never
I ain't never loved a man
The way that I, I love you

Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could ya hurt me so bad
Baby, don't you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had
Oh, kiss me once again
Don't you never, never say that we we're through
Cause I ain't never
No I ain't never
I ain't never loved a man
The way that I, I love you

I can't sleep at night
And I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me

Oh, oh
Yeah! Yeah!
I ain't never loved a man, baby
I ain't never loved a man
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad
I ain't never loved a man


Your cheatin' heart
Will make you weep
You'll cry and cry
And try to sleep
But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you

When tears come down
Like falling rain
You'll toss around
And call my name
You'll walk the floor
The way I do
'Cause your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you

Your cheatin' heart
Will pine some day
And crave the love
You threw away
The time will come
When you'll be blue
'Cause your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you

When tears come down
Like falling rain
You'll toss around
And call my name
You'll walk the floor
The way I do
'Cause your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you
Your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you


I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight, just hoping you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

Oh yeah

Oh yeah
When I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I'm always walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just hoping you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me, oh yeah
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me


That I would be good even if I did nothing
That I would be good even if I got the thumbs down
That I would be good if I got and stayed sick
That I would be good even if I gained ten pounds

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

That I would be fine even if I went bankrupt
That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth
That I would be great if I was no longer queen
That I would be grand if I was not all knowing

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

That I would be loved even when I numb myself
That I would be good even when I am overwhelmed
That I would be loved even when I was fuming
That I would be good even if I was clingy
But you know that I could use somebody
And you know that I could use somebody

You know that I could use somebody
Please, you know that I could use somebody

I've been roaming around, always looking down and all I see
'Cause you know that I could use somebody

That I would be good even if I lost sanity
That I would be good whether with or without you


You said the moon was ours
Yeah-ah
You said the moon was ours
To hell with the day
The sunlight will always take love away
Bring up suspicions and weak alibis
But I can see through tear-blinded eyes

Lies, lies, lies
Oh, lies
La la la la la lies

I got a stone where, where my heart should be
I got a stone where my heart should be
And nothing I do will make you love me
I'll leave this town forget all my pride
It'd be no more use for any disguise

Lies, lies, lies
Oh, lies
La la la la la lies

Oh, I wanna die, oh without pain
Yes, I wanna die, oh, without pain
And all this deception I cn't maintain
The sun, moon, the stars in the sky
It'd hurt me too bad if you said goodbye

So I listen to your
Lies, lies, lies
Oh, lies

La la la la la lies


Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get 
What I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it, you put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get
I get what I want

I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get
I get what I want

Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone


Guess this means you're sorry, you're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back, all you said before
Like how much you wanted, anyone but me
Said you'd never come back, but here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Maybe I was stupid, for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for, trying to pick a fight

I know that I've got issues, but you're pretty messed up too
Either way I've found out, I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Being with you, is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you, but I can't let you go, oh yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you


Miss Independent, Miss Self-Sufficient
Miss Keep Your Distance, mm
Miss Unafraid, Miss Out of My Way
Miss Don't Let a Man Interfere, no
Miss On Her Own, Miss Almost Grown
Miss Never Let a Man Help Her Off Her Throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never, ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
I said ooh, she fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

Miss Guarded Heart, Miss Play It Smart
Miss If You Wanna Use That Line You Better Not Start, no
But she miscalculated, she didn't wanna end up jaded
And this Miss decided not to miss out on true love, so

By changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found in time she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No Longer Afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love, when love is true

Miss Independent


You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over
With someone new
They told you I was moving on
Over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swingin'
You try to break me
But you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the brokenhearted
Thanks to you, I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
When I'm alone


Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes


Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you


I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell by the flames that burned your words?

I never read your letter cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer. Try to make it all okay

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you, you'll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter, you couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer, repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never!

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
I never will
I never will
Never again


Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you
Now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough
To let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

''(Already gone, already gone, already gone)'' ooh woah
Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here 
But something felt so wrong here 
So I'd pray 
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change 
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Breakaway
Breakaway


You've got your mother and your brother
Every other, undercover
Telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid 
But the truth is that it's cupid 
Baby, loving you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know
The situations getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me, how come you never showed? (show)
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (alone)
So before you start defendin'
Baby, stop all your pretendin'...
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow
Let's get this show on the road today, hey...

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I want a love, I want a fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me, die for me
Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me
Cause if you don't then just leave

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

If you don't have the answer (walk away)
Walk away (just walk away)
Just leave (walk away)
Walk away

Walk away


I don't want to be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life

Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadow boxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now

Addicted to the love I've found
Heavy heart now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time

Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I won't spend the rest of my life

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now

You help me see the beauty in everything

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what’s supposed to be right

''(Catch my breath)'' Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now
It's all so simple now

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

''(Catch my breath)'' Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
''(C-c-c-c-c-catch my breath)'' Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now


''We come into this world unknown
But know that we are not alone
They try and knock us down
But a change is coming, it's our turn now''

Hey
Everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes

And hey
Yeah, I know what you're going through
Don't let it get the best of you
You'll make it out alive, oh 

People like us, we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh whoa, oh whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Hey
This is not a funeral
It's a revolution
After all, your tears have turned to rage

Just wait
Everything will be okay
Even when you're feeling like
It's going down to flames, oh

People like us, we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh whoa, oh whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Oh whoa, oh whoa
You just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

They can't do nothing to you
They can't do nothing to me
This is the life that we choose
This is the life that we bleed
So throw your fists in the air
Come out, come out if you dare
Tonight we're gonna change forever

Everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes

Oh, people like us, we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh whoa, oh whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Oh whoa, oh whoa
You just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Oh whoa, oh whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Oh whoa, oh whoa
You just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us


Let's wake up in the afternoon
Pretend that we got nothing to do
No we don't have to go by any agenda
We can make up our own rules

I see the way you're looking at me
Baby, know I'm feeling it too
We can just light up every candle
Move from room to room

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing every day was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Hanging on every touch
Baby don't rush, no no
Baby don't rush

Throwin' the map out the window
Taking a long way around
To a secret place where no one could find us
A little place we can call our own

Come over here and take a picture
Something we can hang on to
We can look back and try to remember
All the crazy things we gonna do

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing every day was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be ''(supposed to be)''
Just hanging on every touch
Baby don't rush
Baby don't rush, yeah yeah

Ooh yeah
Oh yeah

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing every day was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing every day was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be ''(supposed to be)''
Just hanging on every touch
Baby don't rush, no no
Baby don't rush ''(baby, don't rush)''
Baby don't rush, no no
Baby don't rush


What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreaming, but till I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this

Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Oh, like this ''(moment like this)''
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Oh, like this


I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me 
Please have snow and, and mistletoe 
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find you
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams 

Christmas Eve will find me 
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams


Miss Independent, Miss Self-Sufficient
Miss Keep Your Distance, mm
Miss Unafraid, Miss Out of My Way
Miss Don't Let a Man Interfere, no
Miss On Her Own, Miss Almost Grown
Miss Never Let a Man Help Her Off Her Throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never, ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
I said ooh, she fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

Miss Guarded Heart, Miss Play It Smart
Miss If You Wanna Use That Line You Better Not Start, no
But she miscalculated, she didn't wanna end up jaded
And this Miss decided not to miss out on true love, so

By changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found in time she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No Longer Afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love, when love is true

Miss Independent


There's a place that I know
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone
If I show it to you now
Will it make you run away?

Or will you stay, even if it hurts?
Even if I try to push you out, will you return?
And remind me who I really am
Please remind me who I really am

Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me, even with my dark side?

Like a diamond from black dust
It's hard to know what can become if you give up
So don't give up on me
Please remind me who I really am

Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me, even with my dark side?

Don't run away, don't run away
Just tell me that you will stay
Promise me you will stay
Don't run away, don't run away
Just promise me you will stay
Promise me you will stay

Will you love me? Ohh
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me, even with my dark side?

Don't run away, don't run away
Don't run away, promise you'll stay


What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreaming, but till I awake

Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this

Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Oh, like this ''(moment like this)''
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Oh, like this


Love can be a many splendored thing
Can't deny the joy it brings
A dozen roses, diamond rings
Dreams for sale and fairy tales
It'll make you hear a symphony
And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool ya every time

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too
I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps callin'
And I keep on fallin'
Over and over again
This sad story always ends the same
Me standin' in the pourin' rain
It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all


Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead

This may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with the snap of your finger, oh no

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out


He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme, I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold
If I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
It just ain't right, it just ain't right

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight, hold on tight

Oh 'cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy, hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
Waiting so long
So long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends, he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take

Oh 'cause I don't know
Don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster

Oh oh...beautiful
Oh oh...beautiful disaster


Everybody's happy
Snow is falling down
Prayers are being answered
Miracles all around

From afar I've loved you
But never let it show
And every year another
December comes and goes
Always watching
Never reaching

But this Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red

Blue is where I've been
Green can't buy me you
Silver bells remind me
That mistletoe's for two

So I found a color
That only tells the truth
That paints a picture
Of how I feel for you

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red

I'll never feel you
If I don't tell you

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red
Wrapped in red


You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

I found what I was looking for 
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight


Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now



Well out of the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph
Randalph's not too far behind
Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Randalph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph whizzing like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child "What would you like most to get?"
"I want a baby doll that can cry, scream and wet"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a running like a son-of-a-gun.
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a running like a son-of-a-gun.
Run, run... 


Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing silent night
Those Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas by new year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Just as sure as the stars shine above
This is Christmas, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one that you love

Then won't you tell me, you'll never more roam
Christmas and new year will find you at home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
Cause I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again.

Then won't you tell me, you'll never more, you'll never more roam
Christmas and new year will find you at home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
Cause I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again. 


Every Christmas
It's always the same
I'm still here waiting
Praying for you to finally come my way

It's been so long
Since I've seen your face
If Santa cared for me at all then you wouldn't be
So, so far away

Santa isn't listening, no
And I'm losing hope
Oh God if it isn't too much
Please bring my baby home

Every Christmas
Counting the days
Maybe this year will be different
And I won't be, be alone again

Under the mistletoe
Let it snow
Come on home
Every Christmas I'll wait

Oh every Christmas
I turn on all the lights
And I make a fire so maybe the smoke can clear
That you're home tonight

But I just don't know (I don't know)
We'll know deep inside (deep inside)
I know that you should be here, but I feel
We're slowly running out of time

Every Christmas (Christmas)
Counting the days (counting the days)
Maybe this year will be different
And I won't be, be alone again

Under the mistletoe
Let it snow
Come on home
Every Christmas I'll wait

Under the mistletoe
Let it snow
Come on home
Every Christmas I'll wait

Every Christmas, Every Christmas...
I'll wait 


I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas


I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (Baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop by)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (Oh it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say no, no, no sir (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurting my pride?)
I really can't stay (Baby don't hold out)
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go (Baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no (Baby it's cold outside)
This welcome has been (Baby it's cold outside)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that strom)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden Aunt's mind is vicious (Mmm your lips are delicious)
Well maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home (Baby you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I feel when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least they'll be plenty advised (If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (You're over the hold out)
Ah but it's cold outside



Drawing hearts on the foggy glass
New love chase away my past
Nothing but the open road
Saddle up
Here we go...
1,2,3

First winter here in your arms
Flames rising as well fall like stars
Making angels in the snow
Warm, fuzzies, frozen toes...
Is this a dream?

Don't Wake me up
If this is love
Please let me be
Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream
Winter dream
Winter dream

Build a fire to escape the cold
Bing Crosby on the stereo
Tracing letters on my skin
Slowly starts sinkin' in...
You love me

Oh, Don't Wake me up
If this is love
Please let me be
Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter

Dream and dreams
While I'm wide awake
The tree, the lights
Stayin' up late
It's true...
I'm in love with you

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream, dream
Winter dream


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops glisten and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white

Oh I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white


Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eye lashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad.

Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad.

The door's unlocked
And you don't even have to knock
Or you can use the fireplace
I'll be waiting either way

You come and go
And no one is supposed to know
But ever since you caught my stare
You know I know that you are real

Well Santa I've been thinking
And I just need one thing
You to bring me
Something shiny

Oh my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany
Or a big ruby
You know how that's always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh Santa make my Christmas theme
4 carats please

It's getting late
I know you have your rounds to make
But I've been waiting up for you
And now the clock has just struck 2

I'm looking out my windows
Looking for a red nose
My heart's sinking
Don't forget me

Oh my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany
Or a big ruby
You know how that's always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh Santa make my Christmas theme
4 carats please

Mm, something sparkly
Yellow canaries
Oh yea yea
Mm, I'm waiting patiently
Santa don't forget me
Don't forget me!

Oh my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany
Or a big ruby
You know how that's always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh Santa make my Christmas theme
4 carats please


 Just for now
Just for now
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here,
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

How did you know
It's what I've always wanted
Could never have had too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it
Can we settle down please
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Bite tongue
Deep breaths
Count to ten
Nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music
Better quick sharp remove it
Pour me another
Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessness's aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Get me, get me outta here
Get me, get me outta here...

Just for now...
Please 


Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ, the Savior is born
Christ, the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord at thy birth,
Jesus, Lord at thy birth.

Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace


I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me 
Please have snow and, and mistletoe 
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find you
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams 

Christmas Eve will find me 
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams


Oh come, oh come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice, rejoice Emmanuel
Shall come to thee o Israel


This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb

Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long ''(all night long)''

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would've had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a lifetime

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time
One more time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it ''(oh)''
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it ''(oh)''
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long ''(yeah)''

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it ''(oh)''
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long ''(all night long)''

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it ''(oh)''
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long ''(oh)''
Oh, up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long


You know I was broke down
I had hit the ground
I was crying out
Couldn't make no sound
No one hears the silent tears collecting

You know I had lost hope
I was all alone
Never been so low
Till you came along 
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, been down like a waterfall
'Cause baby I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?

I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am a warrior
A shooting star
You know I got this far
I had a broken heart
No one hears silent tears collecting

'Cause it's being weak that's strong
In the truth I'm found
I have the courage now
Gonna shout it out
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, been down like a waterfall
'Cause baby I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?

I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

I was running from an empty threat of emptiness
I was running from an empty threat that didn't exist
I was running from an empty threat of abandonment
I was running from an empty threat that didn't exist

But now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?

I was hiding from the world ''(hoo)'
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible ''(hoo)'
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am invincible ''(hoo)'
No I ain't a scared little girl no more ''(hoo)'
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?
What was I running for?

I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
I was so unsure
But now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm


So this is my apology 
For saying all those shitty things
I wish I didn't really mean
I'm sorry, I'm not sorry

You had your red flags up and raised
More traffic than East L.A.
But I drove in anyway
My common sense on holiday

People fall out of phase
We were a crash course
We will just be a place
Stuck on your passport
You traveled to sometime
But I hope you will find

Someone to cry for
Someone to try for
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets
Someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be
The reason you breathe
Be the reason you breathe

You stay in love like vacation homes
You like summers on the sunny coast
But when the cold needs a winter coat
You say you will until you don't

You wore a compass around your neck
A different North than we'd ever read
Well, did you get where you're going yet?
Wish you the worst, wish you the best

I don't know how I fell into your rearview
Paralyzed lullabies, I couldn't hear you
So I hope you were right
And next to you tonight

There's someone to cry for
Someone to try for
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets
Someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be
The reason you breathe
Be the reason you breathe

So this is my apology
For saying all those shitty things
I wish I really didn't mean
Sorry I'm not sorry


We don't know where this is going now
But I'm feeling love for you
I'm feeling something new, yeah yeah

We don't know where this is going now
But don't be afraid tonight
Don't be afraid of heights, no
Let me open your heart wide

When your angels fall out of the sky
I'll be the wings that make you fly
When you come down I'll take you high
I'll take you high
I'll take you
I'll take you

If I'm dreaming don't roll over yet
Perfect like porcelain
This could be heaven sent, yeah

Kiss the wind and just hold on to me
'Cause in the free fall is when
We get to live again, yeah
Let me open your heart wide

When your angels fall out of the sky
I'll be the wings that make you fly
When you come down I'll take you high
I'll take you high
I'll take you
I'll take you

When we feel down and we're lost and we're wasting away
Let's escape
There's a place deep in your heart where the trouble can't go
That's our home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I'll take you
I'll take you
I'll take you


And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
I travelled 1500 miles to see you
Begged you to want me but you didn't want to

But piece by piece he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandon things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love it isn't free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed so I was worthless

But piece by piece he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandon things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me
Piece by piece he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece

Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first

And you know he'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her
And piece by piece he'll restore my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)'' Piece by piece
''(Oh, oh)''


'''Kelly Clarkson'''
I wonder how your body tastes
Inside of someone else's place
Pull away your eyes, there's nothing left to heal
I'm alone but I know everything you feel

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

'''John Legend'''
Tell me how you closed the door
Knowin' nobody could love you more
'''John Legend & Kelly Clarkson'''
Tellin' all your friends that this love was just made for bleedin'
Hung up underwater but still we keep on tryin' to breathe in

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
But we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

'''Kelly Clarkson'''
Our lust for fighting
Tied up in silence
Yeah

And we waited on the rain
'''John Legend'''
Through tears my heart is caged
'''John Legend & Kelly Clarkson'''
And we fall through fate
But we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Our lust for fighting
Tied up in silence


If you wanna lead, be a leader
If you wanna dream, be a dreamer
Climb to the top of that mountain and scream it... But 
Remember when you get to the top

Everything you say is gonna matter
Everything you do is gonna add up
It's what you asked for... So 
Don't get mad when it's not what you thought

Careful now girl with them Jezebel ways
Crown on your head but you're queen of clichés
Little one playing with the big boys now
Hope you're ready when it comes back around

I had a dream that we were more
A generation to behold
Lighting fires with our words
Instead of useless smoke that blurs the lines of right and wrong
Expression that lives on
An army with a song
That lingers when we're gone
I had a dream

If you wanna preach, be a preacher
If you wanna teach, be a teacher
Remember that the footprints you're leaving... Will
Tell us all who you really are

It's too bad you can't see what you're worth
Spreading your legs 'stead of using your words
Character is shown by the things that we do
The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth

'Cause anyone can tell when they're selling out
And anyone can fly when they're falling down

I had a dream that we were more
A generation to behold
Lighting fires with our words
Instead of useless smoke that blurs the lines of right and wrong
Expression that lives on
An army with a song
That lingers when we're gone
I had a dream

I had a dream

I had a dream that we were more ''(I had a dream that we were more)''
A generation to behold ''(to behold)''
Lighting fires with our words ''(lighting fires with our words)''
Instead of useless smoke that blurs the lines of right and wrong
Expression that lives on ''(lives on)''
An army with a song
That lingers when we're gone ''(when we're gone)''
''(I had a dream)'' I had a dream
I had a dream
I had a dream

I'm on the tightrope
You've got your reasons
When did it get so hard to breathe
Hot in the spotlight
I'm feeling so tired
Your hands are burned from holding me

And maybe you and I will fall in time eventually
Maybe we'll both die trying but I can't bring myself to leave
'Cause I've looked

And I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains, babe just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete

You're on the tightrope
I've got my reasons
How did we get so tangled
You turn, I stay straight
I bend as you break
We're so messed up but I know

That you and I will fall in time eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains, babe just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete

Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, you and I will fall in time eventually
Or maybe we'll both die tryin'

'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you
The way you light up every room tonight so easily
And I have moved mountains, babe just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete


Face to face but miles away
Building trenches out of empty spaces
Lay here next to me
And close the distance in between

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're trying to hide
I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

We could be beautiful without our war paint, our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break, our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint

Scar to scar, I wanna know
Every story that you've never told
Don't shut me out
Don't think too much
Don't keep that barricade up

I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Reveal the things that we're trying to hide
I'll take off yours if you take off mine
Take off mine, yeah

We could be beautiful without our war paint, our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break, our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint

So hold me close 
And kiss my skin
Don't be afraid
Let me in
I'll hold you close 
And take your hand
To my heart, here I am, yeah

We could be beautiful without our war paint, our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break, our walls break
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint

We could be beautiful without our war paint, our war paint
And we could have it all once we let our walls break, our walls break ''(we could have it all)''
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line
When we both know that we're here on the same side
We could be beautiful without the mistake of our war paint
Our war paint


Lights of London, lights of Spain
Lights of New York, lights of L.A.
L.A.

Streets of laughter, streets of pain
The morning crashes, still the night remains
The night remains

And when the music starts and the lights go down
We will all be found
No one's fighting anyone
We're all dancing on the ground

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Feel the music like a lover's kiss
Feel the rhythm like a warm embrace

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah

It's 4:00 AM and the room won't stop
My heart is pounding, how your body rocks
Your body rocks

My lips, they quiver on your skin
Let's take this dance and just breathe you in
Breathe you in

And when the music starts and the lights go down
We will all be found
No one's fighting anyone
We're all dancing on the ground

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Feel the music like a lover's kiss
Feel the rhythm like a warm embrace

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah

''Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me''

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah

Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah


Don't be sad that it's over
Just be happy that it happened to us 
Don't look back and remember
Drunken tears, oh remember the love

In my head I see you laughing
From the words I said, felt like a new a beginning
In my head I see you standing there
The words you said, felt like a story ending

''(We will never)'' ever be the same 
''(The picture changes)'' but not the frame
''(When I'm sleeping)'' I still kiss your face
''(I can't have it)'' when I'm awake

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Nostalgic

I wonder if you're wearing
That gold chain with a promise from me
Honestly felt so real then
Even now it's not hard to believe

In my head I see you laughing
From the words I said, felt like a new a beginning
In my head I see you standing there
The words you said, felt like a story ending

''(We will never)'' ever be the same
''(The picture changes)'' but not the frame
''(When I'm sleeping)'' I still kiss your face
''(I can't have it)'' when I'm awake

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Nostalgic

''(We will never)'' ever be the same
''(We will never)'' ever be the same
''(We will never)'' ever be the same
Never be the same

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even if we wanted
I still get nostalgic
Nostalgic


They say Rome wasn't built in a day
But you and I went and built it anyway
And it only took a second to watch it all fall to dust

I thought you hung up the moon
And you thought I lit up the room
But the lights turned off and that was the end of us

Slam goes the door
Hush goes the phone
Out goes the flame
And I'm standing here alone

Burn goes the drink
Down go the tears
Drip goes the sink
And I'm missing you like hell

Break goes the heart
Wrong goes the right
Good goes the bye

It's like we pulled a pin out of a grenade
It just didn't go off right away
But man did it off when it finally did

And everything suddenly magnified
It's loud and it's quiet at the same time
As the echo of ''"it's all over"'' sets in

Slam goes the door
Hush goes the phone
Out goes the flame
And I'm standing here alone

Burn goes the drink
Down go the tears
Drip goes the sink
And I'm missing you like hell

Break goes the heart
Wrong goes the right
Good goes the bye

We can't go back
We can't be friends
And we can't be what we were then
You can't be mine
And I can't be yours
And it's not love anymore

Slam goes the door ''(slam goes the door)''
Hush goes the phone ''(hush goes the phone)''
Out goes the flame ''(out goes the flame)''
And I'm standing here alone

Burn goes the drink ''(burn goes the drink)''
Down go the tears ''(down go the tears)''
Drip goes the sink ''(drip goes the sink)''
And I'm missing you like hell

Break goes the heart ''(break goes the heart)''
Wrong goes the right ''(wrong goes the right)''
Goodbye


My love's a weapon and I'm knockin' 'em dead
I got a heart that's tough as leather
Get what I want and just forget 'em
Well this game you're playin' is a Russian Roulette
Just 'cause I'm sweet when we're together
Doesn't mean I'm yours forever

Never should have looked into your eyes
Now everybody's gonna see how I feel

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin'
'Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You'll never see stars shinin' in in my eyes
Yeah ruining ruining my my bad reputation

Oh no oh oh no no
Oh no oh oh no no

Well I tell 'em, tell 'em, yeah you're nothing to me
I tell 'em that you, you're just another
You're just like any other
Well I try to sell 'em but they ain't buyin' it
Baby, they see me start to stutter 
When they ask if you're my lover

I'm losing sleep, what's gotten into me?
I'm usually never this weak, baby

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin'
'Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You'll never see stars shinin' in in my eyes
Yeah ruining ruining my my bad reputation

Oh no oh oh no no
Oh no oh oh no no

I have got to pull myself together 
But I can't control it
My lips, they know what they want
Everybody knows it
Once a girl controlled the world with words that pierced the bone
Now I'm smiling like a lovesick pup
And everybody knows it 

Don't go ruining, ruining my my bad reputation
Don't go telling them, telling them all the plans we've been makin'
'Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You'll never see stars shinin' in in my eyes
Yeah ruining ruining my my bad reputation

Oh no oh oh no no
Oh no oh oh no no

'Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You'll never see stars shinin' in in my eyes
Yeah ruining ruining my my bad reputation
Oh no


Some days I barely miss you, some days I'm almost alright
And some nights I turn to kiss you but you're not beside my side
Got this same damn conversation playin' over and over in my mind
In my mind

Yeah my heart it's wet and heavy but my body's on the run
'Cause the night is gonna get me and it's only just begun
I keep livin' on the memory of you and me, you me in the sun, 
In the sun

No matter where you are
A little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue
In a thousand years
We'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue

Yeah I'm runnin' from this city like a diamond in the sky
And I'm tryin' to count my blessings 'stead of all the tears I've cried
I keep driving in this darkness to get you, to get you off my mind, 
Off my mind

I'll start over in a new place get my feet back on the ground
Can't believe the mess that I've made just trying to drown you out
Maybe one day I won't miss you
I'll stop looking for you in the crowd
In the crowd

No matter where you are
A little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue
In a thousand years
We'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue

I see your face in every stranger
Footsteps down the hall
Warm breath, back of my neck
Shadows on the wall
And your voice is loud as thunder hey
I can hear it crashin' in my head, yeah

No matter where you are
A little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue
In a thousand years
We'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue

I'll be forever with you
In the blue
In the blue

I was standin' with my friend 
When I saw you walkin' in 
And my heart started skippin' a beat 

I was tryin' to play it cool 
But I knew it was true 
That nobody would ever compete 

Well first comes love and then comes...

First date first kiss 
We were checkin' off the list 
Then you were gettin' down on your knee 

And you didn't have to guess 
It was a always a yes 
Now there's 2 less fish in the sea 

Let's set the date 
Let's hire a band 
Let's cut the cake 
Tie up the cans 
I love the ring of your name 
You're the ying to my yang 
Oh baby let's give it a shot 
Every wall needs a frame 
Every ball needs a chain 
I'm talkin' 'bout tying the knot 
Tie it up 

Something old, something new 
Something borrowed, something blue 
And the chairs lined up in the yard 

The I do's and the kisses 
From a Miss to a Misses 
Can't wait for forever to start 

Let's set the date 
Let's hire a band 
Let's cut the cake 
Tie up the cans

Invite the town 
Raise a glass and lock it down 
Tie it up 
Forever bound 
'Cause I'm fit to be tied down 

When Mama's kickin' off her shoes 
And Daddy's spinnin' from the booze 
And the last song is finally sung 

We can run to the room 
Kickstart the honeymoon 
Don't it sound like a whole lotta fun? 

Let's set the date 
Let's hire a band 
Let's cut the cake 
Tie up the cans

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
A natural woman

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
Cause if I make you happy U don't need to do more

Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
A natural woman

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
Oooo you make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me feel so alive

You make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
A natural woman


Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear saviour's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til he appeared
And the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine

Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear saviour's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til he appeared
And the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine


Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list

As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list

What is this illusion called the innocence of you
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list


Anytime you feel like you just can't hold on 
Just hold onto my love and I'll help you be strong
But you're so afraid to lose, and baby I can't reach your heart
I can't face this world that's keeping us apart
When I could be the one to show you
Everything you missed before
Just hold on now, cause I can be the one to give you more
Yes, you know

Anytime you need love baby I'm on your side, yeah
Just let me be the one that can make it alright
I can make it alright
Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart
I can make it alright

I looked into your eyes 
And I feel it comin' through
And I can't help but want you more than I want to
So baby, take all of your fears
And cast them all on me
Cause all I ever wanted was just to make you see
That I could be the one to give you
All that you've been searchin' for
Just hold onto my love
And baby, let me give you more
You know

Anytime/anytime you need love baby I'm on your side/hey
Just let me be the one, I can make it all right
I can make it alright
Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart
I can make it alright

Now there's no way out 
And I can't help the way I feel
Cause baby, you're the fire
And I'll be waitin' right here
You know my love is real baby, yeah

Yeah
I'm on your side
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
Alright

Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart
I can make it alright
Alright


I've been wonderin' if it's time
To say what's on my mind
'Cause I'm in the dark
What was in your heart

(What's in your heart)
I don't even know your name
But the thought of you remains
Suddenly my pulse is jumping 
Do you feel the same

Talk it over with my friends
And I guess it all depends
How you really feel, but can you comprehend
You could be just around the corner now
Hoping this love is yet to be found

It's not too late to call my name
So don't you look the other way
Open your eyes and you'll see
My heart won't wait, don't hesitate
We got a chance, we've gotta take
It feels like you could be
Forever part of me

Can be right under my skin (right under my skin)
I don't know where to begin
Would I look the fool
Should I play it cool
Or jump right in

How am I supposed to know
Whether I should come or go
Think it's time we let our feelings show
We might let the moment just pass us by
Then it's gone in the blink of an eye

It's not too late to call my name
So don't you look the other way
Open your eyes and you'll see
My heart won't wait, don't hesitate
We got a chance we've gotta take
It feels like you could be
Forever part of me


Boy I'd do almost anything
Just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line

Waiting for your call
Just to take a fall
Oh I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line


Honey, I can tell by the wonderin' look in your eye, you're just a little boy
With about a thousand lines

And the girl you say is always on your mind
Ya just sit and watch her walk outta your life

(Well you) talk of love
(and) talk is cheap
(And you) change your mind 
(Like you) change your sheets
(And me)
You're doin' things that I don't like 
(But still)
It ain't right 

(Well, it must be the madness) must be the madness
And the magic that I feel inside
Must be the music
And the rhythm
Playin' with my mind
Must be the chemistry, you and me
That I can't deny
I wanna tell you I love you, love you, love you, but I can't decide

-- bump, bump, bump diget... bump, bump, bump diget... bump, bump, bump diget
DIGET DIGET DIGET - 

It's funny, you can't tell by the way I use my words
I'm all fed up
And it's so absurd

That the whole wide world can see what you don't
I'm just a simple girl
Yet I'm the one you want

(And ya) talk enough
(Cause) talk is free
(And you) you're too young to handle me
(So) I'm looking for a whole new vibe
(And still)
You look right

(Well, it must be the madness) must be the madness 
And the magic that I feel inside 
Must be the music (it must be the music)
And the rhythm 
Playin' with my mind 
Must be the chemistry, you and me 
That I can't deny (wanna tell you I love you)
I wanna tell you I love you, love you, love you, but I can't decide 

-- bump, bump - bump diget... bump, bump - bump diget... 
bump, bump - bump diget...DIGET DIGET DIGET - (yeah)

(Well, it must be the madness) must be the madness 
And the magic that I feel inside 
Must be the music (it must be the music)
And the rhythm 
Playin' with my mind 
Must be the chemistry, you and me 
That I can't deny I wanna tell you 
I love you, love you, love (Love you..Love you..)

Vacation all I ever wanted
Vacation had to get away
Vacation meant to be spent alone

Vacation all I ever wanted
Vacation had to get away
Vacation meant to be spent alone
...Meant to be spent alone

A week without you, thought i'd forget
two weeks without you and i still haven't gotten over you yet

Vacation all I ever wanted
Vacation had to get away
Vacation meant to be spent alone

Vacation all I ever wanted
Vacation had to get away
Vacation meant to be spent alone

A week without you, thought i'd forget
two weeks without you and i still haven't gotten over you yet

Vacation all I ever wanted
Vacation had to get away
Vacation meant to be spent alone
..Spent alone


At last, my love has come long,
My lonely days are over,
And life is like a song

Ohhh, at last,
The skies above are blue,
My heart was wrapped up in clover,
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream that I can call my own,
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to,
A thrill that I have never known

Ohhh yeah yeah, you smile, you smile,
And then the spell was cast,
And here we are in heaven,
For you are mine at last!


You're all I need to get by
Like the sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you

I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, its enough
You're all
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You?re all all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one

You're all
You're all I need
You're all I need 
Oh yeah yeah
You're all I need to get by

Oh you are
Oh you are

Oh yah yah yah
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Aww Yah



Dont play that song for me
'Cuz it brings back memories
Of the days that I once knew
And all the days that I spent with you

Oh no, dont let it play (oh no)
It fills my heart with pain (it hurts)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just what it said
It said darling ( darling I)
You know that ya lied (darling I)
Boy, ya know that ya lied (darling I)
You know that ya lied (ya lied) ya lied (ya lied) ya lied
I remember on our first date
You kissed me then you walked away
And I was only 17
And I never dreamed that he could be so mean

Oh darling (darlin...oh no)
Dont ya play it no more (play it no more)
Dont you dare play that song (dont play it no more)
oooo oooo oooo oh no (ya lie, ya lie) YA LIE...



I was alone on a shelf
In a world by myself
Oh, where could my prince charming be?
But a man came along
Made my life like a song
And taught me these words of ecstasy...
Tenderly...

I want some huggin
And some squeezin
And some lovin
And some teasin
And some stuff like that there
I want some pettin
And some spoonin
And some happy honeymoonin
And some stuff like that there

I used to think that love was just a lot of rubbish
A mess o cabbage, a mess o cabbage
But now my attitude is only lovey-dovish
And baby you, you done it---

Ooh

I used to think romance was bunk
A double-mickey for the hickey
But all at once my heart was sunk
And baby you, you done it

I want some huggin
And some teasin
And some muggin
And some pleasin'
And some stuff like that there
I want some weepin
And some chasin
And some sweepin
And some pacin
And some stuff like that there

And when I get a certain feeling
I confess it
There's really only one expression to express it
I want some huggin
Squeezin
Muggin
Teasing
And some stuff
I want some stuff like that there-ere-ere-ere-ere


Ooohooh
If you see me walking down the street and I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by...boy walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears just let me grieve
In private cuz each time I see you
I break down and cry
Boy walk on by
I just can't get over losing you and so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Boy walk on by
Foolish pride is all that I can feel so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Boy walk on by
oooh ooh yea make believe that you don't see the tears honey
Let me grieve in private cuz each time I see you I just break down
And cry ooh oh
Just walk on by
Walk on walk on
Ooooh ooh boy walk on by



Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half past ten
For the first time in history
Its gonna start raining men

Its raining men
Halleyluya
Its raining men

Tall, Long, Dark and lean
Rough, and tough as u ever seen

In the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip of the roof and stay in bed

Its raining men
Hallehluya
Its raining men
singel women



There's so much life, I've left to live
And this fire's burning still
What would happen if they ever knew
I'm in love with you?

Cause I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
I surrender

Every night's, getting longer
And this fire's getting stronger, baby
I'll swallow all my pride
And I'll be alive
Did you hear my call?
I surrender all
(I surrender everything, to feel the chance to live again)
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
I surrender



Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

Well I can't forget this evening
Nor your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
(No I cant live)
(No I cant live)
I cant live
(No I cant live)
(No I cant live)
If living is without you



Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong,
You've been sweetest part of my life for so long!
I look in your eyes there's a distant light,
And you and I know there'll be storm tonight!
But baby this is serious,
Are you thinking about you or us?

Don't say what you're about to say!
Look back before you leave my life.
Be sure before you close that door!
Before you roll those dice,
Baby think twice!

Baby this is serious!
Are you thinking about you or us?
Baaaaaaaaaaby!!!!!
NO NO NO NO
Look back before you leave my life!
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice!!!
Don't depend on you!!!
Be sure before you sacrafice!
Before you roll those dice,
Baby think twice!!!!


[Performed at Lifetime's Women Who Rock Concert]

There was a time 
When I was so brokenhearted 
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine 
The tables have turned, yeah 
'Cause me and them ways have parted 
That kind of love was the killin' kind, listen 
All I want is someone I can't resist 
I know all I need to know by the way that you kissed me 

I was cryin' when I met you 
Now I'm tryin to forget you 
your Love is sweet misery 
I was cryin' just to get you 
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you 
Do what you do down on me 

Now there's not even breathin' room 
No, no, no 
Between pleasure and pain 
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love 
Must be one and the same 

'Cause what you got inside 
Ain't where your love should stay 
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love 
'Till you give your heart away 
Yeeeaaahhh 
I was cryin' when I met you 
Now I'm tryin to forget you 
Your Love is sweet misery 
I was cryin' just to get you 
Now I'm dyin' cos to let you 
Do what you down on, down on, baby, baby, baby 

Baby, yeah


Breathe in, breathe out
Restless, waiting for anything
Tension is thick in the air
Are you gonna lead or follow me
Full speed
Turn up the overdrive
Makes me feel glad that I'm alive
This time, we've finally made our move
So come on, come on, come on, come on

Oh!

Let's go, let's jump right in
Scream into the wind, feel the fire within
I can't ignore this burning in my soul
Come on, baby let's go
We might fall fast, we might fall hard
But I can take it, I need to know
So come on, baby go

Fever in my eyes
Starts racing back and forth in my mind
I feel emotions rush through me
Stirring such passion inside of me
Are we regressing or taking flight
I'd rather be loud than just stay quiet
It's time to make a move
It's time, we've nothing to lose
So come on, come on, come on, come on

Oh!

Let's go, let's jump right in
Scream into the wind, feel the fire within
I can't ignore this burning in my soul
Come on, baby let's go
We might fall fast, we might fall hard
But I can take it, I need to know
So come on, baby go

No one to stand in our way and nothing's holding us back
Doesn't matter what they say it's just you and me
I'm so glad it turns out what I didn't know
And I was too scared to show
Lose control of my soul
Come on, now

Let's go, let's jump right in
Scream into the wind, feel the fire within
I can't ignore this burning in my soul
Come on, baby let's go
We might fall fast, we might fall hard
But I can take it, I need to know
So come on, baby, go

Breathe in
Breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe out
Breathe out


I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm ok
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' It
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still Harder
Getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

Not seeing that loving you
That's what I was trying to do


I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be

But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights

But does he love you (does he love you)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you (does he think of you)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin' me

But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?

But does he love you (does he love you)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you (does he think of you)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) of his fantasies
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin me

Oh shouldn't I lose my temper
Oh but shouldn't I be ashamed
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain

But does he love you (does he love you)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you (does he think of you)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) of his fantasies
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin me


I went up to the mountain
Because you asked me to
Up over the clouds
To where the sky was blue
I could see all around me
Everywhere
I could see all around me
Everywhere

Sometimes I feel like
I've never been nothing but tired
And I'll be walking
Till the day I expire
Sometimes I lay down
No more can I do
But then I go on again
Because you ask me to

Some days I look down
Afraid I will fall
And though the sun shines
I see nothing at all
Then I hear your sweet voice, oh
Oh, come and then go, come and then go
Telling me softly
You love me so

The peaceful valley
Just over the mountain
The peaceful valley
Few come to know
I may never get there
Ever in this lifetime
But sooner or later
It's there I will go
Sooner or later
It's there I will go


I can show you the world,
Shining, shimmering, splendid,
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes,
Take you wonder by wonder,
Over, sideways and under,
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world,
A new fantastic point of view,
No one to tell us no,
Or where to go,
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world,
A dazzling place I never knew,
But when I'm up here,
It's crystal clear,
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights,
Indescribable feeling,
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling,
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world


My tired eyes are beckon for release
For sleep
I always seem to want the one who's just a little
Out of reach
Maybe I just can't love
What I can keep
My love, you are
The best friend that I'll ever have

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
Afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone

His lips try not to tremble
When he speaks
My tired breath falls so heavy
On his cheek
But I'll never know just what I have
Unless I leave
Here in the end
I hope that I'm not just running again

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes

Over my head
Afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone

Here in the end
I hope that I'm not just running again
Here in the end
I hope that I'm not just running again

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
Afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
Afraid of the light
What can you say to not hurt someone
After the love is gone


Will:
Listen, baby,
Ain't no mountain high,
Ain't no valley low,
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

Kelly:
If you need me, call me,
No matter where you are,
No matter how far

Will:
Don't worry, baby

Kelly:
I'll be there in a hurry,
You don't have to worry

Both:
'Cause, baby, there
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough,
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Will:
Remember the day when I set you free,
I told you could always, always count on me

Kelly:
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me, someday, somehow

Both:
'Cause, baby, there
Ain't no mountain high enough,


Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough,
To keep me from getting from you, babe

Will:
Oooo, darling

Kelly:

No wind, no rain,
No winters cold,
Can stop me now

Will:
Don't stop me, baby

Kelly:
'Cause you are my goal,
Oooo, baby

Will (while Kelly is singing):
When you are in trouble,
I'll be there on the double,
Just send for me

(Lots of chorus and random words)

Both:
'Cause, baby, there 
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough,
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Ain't no mountain high enough!


For all I know, you could be near 
and every breath I take, you could feel 
For all I know, you're just a thought that crossed my mind 
What I wouldn't give to live that thought of mine. 

For all I know is nothing's changed 
Nothing ever will if I don't leave this place 
For all I know, you're waiting for me to whisper your name 
What I wouldn't give to kiss your sweet face 

Cause all I know is I need you here 
And all I have, I would give away so I could say this dear 
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel 
It's killing me 

For all I know, you forgot me 
For all I know, you're different, completely 
And everything we had was never what I thought it was 
But for all I know, oh it was love. 

Cuz all I know is I need you here 
All I have, I would give away to so I could say this dear
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel 
It's killing me 

Now everyone has a name 
And every face always somehow looks the same 
I always feel so alone, especially when it rains 
For all I know, boy, you do the same, yeah 

Yeah I didn't know that I need you here 
All I had, I gave away cause I was still afraid to feel 
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel 
It's killing me, it's killing me 

All I know 
All I know 
For all I know


You know you're everything to me and I could never see
The two of us apart
And you know I give myself to you and no matter what you do
I promise you my heart

I've built my world around you and I want you to know
I need you like I've never needed already gone before

I'm already gone for you
I wanna be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I'm already gone for you

I dedicate my life to you, you know that I would die for you
But our love would last forever
And I will always be with you and there is nothing we can't do
As long as we're together

I just can't live without you and I want you to know
I need you like I've never needed already gone before

I'm already gone for you
I wanna be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I'm already gone for you

(Already gone)
(Already gone)
(Already gone)

You know you're everything to me and I could never see
The two of us apart

I want you to know, I need you like I've never needed already gone before

I'm already gone for you
I wanna be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I'm already gone for you, oh, yeah
I'm already gone for you


In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort there

Ave Maria! Maiden mild 
Oh! listen to a maiden's pray'r 
For thou canst hear 'em in the wild 
'Tis Thou, 'Tis thou canst save amid despair 
We slumber safely 'till the 'morrow 
Though we by men outcast, reviled 
O Maiden, see a maiden's sorrow 
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child! 
Ave Maria... 

Ave Maria, gratia plena 
Maria, gratia plena 
Maria, gratia plena 

Ave, ave dominus 
Dominus tecum 

The murky cavern's air so heavy 
Shall breathe of balm if Thou hast smil'd 
Oh Maiden, hear a maiden pleading 
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child! 
Ave Maria... 
Ave Maria...

Repeat chorus till fade.


Always crossing fingers
Holding back
Drawing circles on the floor

Pretending you don't see me
Blinding your self completly
Running from the hands that hold you high

Hold on this time
I will take you 
To where you belong
Hold on this time
You don't have to 
Bleed for me
You don't have to 
Bleed for me


I've been holding every breathing and
It's all I can do
Haging on every word and
Just like a fool, I throught I could get over you

So Call me, when you fall in love
So I can get on with my life
Call me, when you find the one
I've been thinking what I was all this time
When you fall in love
Call me

Taking the long away hope and
When I get home
It's all just been a bad dream
Then I'm not alone
And you aren't gone and move on

So Call me, when you fall in love
So I can get on with my life

Call me, when you find the one
I've been thinking what I was all this time
When you fall in love
Call me

Even know I know its wrong
The holding to this holding on
Its coping, what could it be?
I know the truth, and know it hurts
And now I know its not the worst
Letting go it's not give in
So Call me, when you fall in love
So I can get on with my life
So call me, when you find the one
I've been thinking what I was all this time
When you fall in love
Call me

You left me standing there 
You didn't even care 
You just walked away 
I felt so scared 
You never even looked back at me 
So unaware of how cruel you could be 
I was always there 
Did you ever care? 

Did you ever care for me? 
Did you ever believe in me? 
Did you ever love me? 
Did you? Did you? Did you? 

You didn't have to fall 
I didn't need your tears 
I didn't want your pity 
Just any feeling at all would have been sufficient 
I never felt so small, so insignificant 
You left me naked with nothing at all 
How could I be so blind? 

Did you ever care for me? 

Did you ever believe in me? 
Did you ever love me? 
Did you? Did you? Did you? 

Falling down 
Darkness surrounds me 
I open my eyes 
I bow my head and cry 

Did you ever believe in me? 
Did you ever even love me? 

Did you ever care for me? 
Did you ever believe in me? 
Did you ever love me? 
Did you? Did you? Did you? 

Did you ever care for me? 
Did you ever love me?


I know I break your heart
With everything I'm not
Don't ever give up on me
Remember that we're strong
And even as we fall
Don't ever give up on me

These tears I'm holdin back
Could turn my whole face black
And I don't know if you'd love me 
If you saw me like that 
Would you?

Would you follow if I turned my back
Could you love me through this broken glass
I know I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

My heart would turn to run
But even when I'm gone
Don't ever give up on me
I'm tryin deep within
If you could hold my hand
Don't ever give up on me

This war I'm fightin havoc
It turns me inside out and 

I don't know if you'd love me 
If you saw me right now
Would you?

Would you follow if I turned my back
Could you love me through this broken glass
I know I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

How do you?
How do you?
Still believe in me
Even when 
Even when
All my colors bleed
Holdin out 
Holdin out
Will you love the rest of me

Would you follow if I turned my back
Could you love me through this broken glass
I know I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

You look at me,
Like you always do.
You dont have a clue.
You smile at me,
You hug me,
But you dont know I want you.
You play with me,
You flirt with me,
You tell me all your secrets.
Im always the one you run to, 
but to you Im just your friend.

Dont say I love you,
Dont say you need me,
Dont say I trust you,
My heart cant take it.
Dont say you want me,
Dont say you miss me,
Dont hurt me.
Dont say you love me.

Ooooh ooooh no... no.. nooo.

I try my best to rid these thoughts,
Of you and I its so hard.
When come to me, 
I fall back on my knees.
I learned to hate love.
You kiss me on the cheek,
You say youd never make it without me.
Its getting harder everyday.
Please dont say to me,

Dont say I love you,
Dont say you need me,
Dont say I trust you,
My heart cant take it.
Dont say you want me,
Dont say you miss me,

Dont hurt me.
Dont say you love me.

Dont say you love me.
Dont say you love me.
Dont say you love me.
Dont say you love me.

My heart cant take it.
I love you so much.
But you dont see me.
I hate love.

Dont say I love you,
Dont say you need me,
Dont say I trust you,
Unless you mean it.
Dont say you want me,
Dont say you need me,
Dont hurt me.
No...

Dont say I love you,
Dont say you need me,
Dont say I trust you,
My heart cant take it.
Dont say you want me,
Dont say you miss me,
Dont hurt me.
Dont say you love me.


I got caught in between
I just let love win
I'm not prod of you
But I can't change what I feel

I believed in you
You took care of me
Were you faking all this time?
Why did you leave?

Now I'm numb,
I can barely breath

You couldn't resist me
So scared
You had to leave me
Empty as I am

Face your demons
I'm here to stay
Please don't leave me
Empty as I am

I feel so stupid

So betrayed
I gave you my trust
And this is how you pay

You think I won't fight for this
I'll do what it takes
I'm willing to give up my life
Just to have one more kiss

Now I'm empty
I can barely feel

You couldn't resist me
So scared
You had to leave me
Empty as I am

Face your demons
I'm here to stay
Please don't leave me
Empty as I am


Did you know that nothing was right
Were you just happy to hide
Behind dreams and broken lies
There's a crack in your perfect smile
That's been growing a while
Did you think you'd go out in style

With all that you know
How long did you know

You took me for granted
I don't understand it
While looking for answers
I came up empty handed
But don't worry about me
Cause I'm stronger then you think
And I know its a blessing
I came up empty handed

Can you be whoever you like
You just turn off the lights
And find yourself a different disguise
So you hide the scars you built over time
Do you think I'm blind
You're still lovely on the inside

With all that you know
How long did you know

You took me for granted

I don't understand it
While looking for answers
I came up empty handed
Don't worry about me
Cause I'm stronger than you think
And I know its a blessing
I came up empty handed
Empty handed

When did you know that nothing was right
Were you just happy to hide
Behind dreams and broken lies

With all that you know
Why didn't you just go...

You took me for granted
I don't understand it
While looking for answers
I came up empty handed
But don't worry about me
Cause I'm stronger then you think
And I know its a blessing
I came up empty handed
Empty handed
Empty handed
Empty handed


She was abused he thought it brung amused but it Really brought  pain
The shame being known as the girl with no name it Droved her insane
The lie's,rumors,and the blame she couldn't no Longer take the rain

She was only 15 she didn't now where her dreams Led she wanted to be a singer
But didn't know about the pain it might bring her Fed up,fed up ohhh she was fed up

She thought she was in love with the boy  that Brung her down left her everyday
With a frown black eyes on her way too school but She always kept it cool
But the tears layed inside questions why pop in Her head late at night while
sShe sit on her bed wishing she was dead.


Chorus repeat

Wednesday, never felt so cold here
Found your letter
Didn't know your words could hurt me still
Laying on the ground, nothing I can do
But wait it out
Creeping in, slowly wearing me down
And I remember
Changing everything I used to need
His arms don't fit the way yours did
But at least they're holding me
He will never leave me, he will never break me
Like you do
And he will never be you

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again
And I remember

Closer, closer than I like to be
Loving him and letting go of you isn't easy
Nothing you can do, nothing he can be
Nothing I can ever say
I'll keep you here till you fade away

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again
And I remember

I could fight it, try and forget you
I could fight it but I don't want to

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again
And I remember you


And I try not to think about dinner for one
Close my eyes and pretend that this house is a home
'Cause I've got to believe
I'm not the only one

And I try not to dream about finding someone
Who might share all the reasons why love hasn't come
'Cause I've got to believe
I'm not the only one

Breathing
I'm not the only heart beating
There's nothing worse than just feeling
The weight of walking alone
Tell me
I'm not the only one

And I keep all my hopes from clouding my eyes
Keep my distance, my chin up, and talk with a smile
'Cause I've got to believe there's more than barely

Breathing
I'm not the only heart beating

There's nothing worse than just feeling
The weight of walking alone
Tell me
I'm not the only one

Empty and crawling
Wincing and falling
Back into this skin
Said I'm leaving
It's not what I wanted
The will I keep on

Breathing
Be the only heart beating
There's nothing worse than just feeling
The weight of walking alone
Tell me
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Am I the only one?


I think you've touched my hand
Or maybe hurt me again
What did you say that made me blush
I think you laughed at me
First dates are always fun
I think that when I fell in love

First kiss first moment that I knew
First time you said I love you
First day I started to forget
I still have all your pictures
Sometimes I do remember
You come and go like all the rest

It's been so long since i left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
No where to go walkin' alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost

Sometimes I get a glance of
You and me and we're dancin'
As if things they never change
You hold me closer to you
I watch you fade and soon you
You just, you slip away

Cause, It's been so long since I left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
No where to go walkin' alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost

(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhhhh)

It's been so long since I left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
No where to go walkin' alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost

Cause, its been so long since I left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
No where to go walkin' alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost


Somewhere in the night, there is darkness, there is light
And I'm reaching within to find where the sadness ends
Cause maybe then I'll know why I always feel alone
I need something to hold something to call my own

Find a wishing well or a shooting star
Find a fairytale that takes me so far
Away from here I just want to feel more

Cause I've been waiting all my life
For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn
Nothing ever turns out right
But I'll still believe that someday I'll see that
It's never too late to find
Love in these eyes
Love in these eyes

Sometimes I get tired
It's like this road goes on for miles
And nobody knows how hard it is to smile
Smile

Find a wishing well or a shooting star
Find a fairytale that takes me so far
Away from here I just want to feel more

Cause I've been waiting all my life

For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn
Nothing ever turns out right
But I'll still believe that someday you'll see that
It's never too late as long as it takes
It's never too late to find
Love in these eyes

Someday I'll look in the mirror
And staring at me
Will be the person I am
And the person that I always thought I could be

Cause I've been waiting all my life
For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn

And nothing ever turns out right
But I'll still believe that
Someday you'll see that
It's never too late as long as it takes
It's never too late to find
Love in these eyes

Love in these eyes, in these eyes
[repeat]


I know that I hurt you,
With these words that,
Just keep slipping from my tongue,
(from my tongue)
I know I'll desert you before you,
Can when I think you'll run,
Before you run,

Love, it's complicated,
My heart, it hesitates,
You know love seems far and distant,
For some, for some,
Don't let go, I'm almost there,
Don't say things you can't take back,

Don't you say, don't you say,
That you're walking away from me,
Lover stay, lover stay,
I can't help my mind to play,
I won't change if you won't change,
My heart breaks when you go away,
So lover stay, lover stay
With me... (Oh Oh)

I know I'm not thick skin, 

Where it holds onto your heart,
But I am trying, I am trying,
Letting go has never,
Been to easy for the lonely,
But in time, but in time,

Love, it takes a breath away,
Love, it leaves no choice to make,
Love means everything for some(for some),
I will let you in, but 
Please, when I do,
Remember one thing,

Don't you say, don't you say, 
That you're walking away from me,
Lover stay, lover stay, 
I can't help my mind to play,
I won't change if you won't change,
My heart breaks when you go away,
So lover stay, lover stay
With me... (Oh Oh)

Well I've been down to my last dime 
Down to my last dance 
Down to the last time 
Down to my last chance 

Well  I've been down to nothing, left at all a time or two 
This time I think I'm down to something, I can't afford to lose 

I think I'm down to my last broken heart 
I think I'm falling in love with you 
I'm just afraid to start 
But untill I know for sure our love won't fall apart 

Cause I think I'm down to my last broken heart 

Well I can feel the spark of love and it's a sweet dream 
But will there be enough to keep on burning 
Well I've felt the flame of love before 
And I watched it burning out 
This time I wanna know for sure, without a doubt 

I think I'm down to my last broken heart 
I think I'm falling in love with you 
I'm just afraid to start 
But untill I know for sure our love won't fall apart 


Saw it with my naked eye
Seeing is believing
Funny when you realize
You gotta stop feeling
Watched you leave my side
When it really matters
Watched your straight face lie
Saying it'll be alright, it's alright

Can't take back what you can't change
Can't fix whats more than broken
Can't tell me paranoia's to blame
I saw it with my naked eye
My naked eye

Saw it with my naked eye
I'm losing a battle
Were you ever on my side
It's never been settled
Watched you fall way side when it really mattered ??
What you waste my heart you know it's not alright alright

Can't take back what you can't change
Can't fix what's more than broken
Can't tell me paranoia's to blame
I saw it with my naked eye
My naked eye

Hands are red (it's too late now)
Words so cheap (it's too late now)
Broken promises (it's too late now)
Breaking me

Can't take back what you can't change
Can't fix whats more than broken
Can't tell me paranoia's to blame
I saw it with my naked eye
My naked eye
My naked eye
My naked eye


Espero que el anillo que le regalaste
le deje el dedo verde
Espero que cuando estés con ella en la cama
pienses en mí
Nunca le desearía a nadie nada malo
pero no te deseo nada bueno

Nunca leí tu carta
porque sabía lo que dirías
Me das esa respuesta de catequesis
esperando solucionar así todo

(ESTRIBILLO)
¿Duele
saber que nunca estaré ahí?
Apuesto a que
jode ver mi cara por todas partes
Fuiste tú
quien eligío acabar como lo has hecho
Fui la última en enterarme
Sabías
perfectamente lo que ibas a hacer
Y No digas 
que es que te perdiste
Puede que ella te crea
pero yo nunca lo haré
Nunca más

Si es cierto que conoce la verdad
te merece
Una mujer trofeo, ¡ay,qué mona!
Ojos que no ven, corazón que no siente
Pero cuando llegue tu hora
y haya acabado contigo
porque acabará contigo
Moriréis juntos pero solos
Me escribiste una carta
No pudiste decírmelo a la cara
Me das esa respuesta de catequesis
Ve a arrepentirte a otro sitio

(ESTRIBILLO)


¿Duele

Nunca más volveré a escucharte
Nunca más volveré a echarte de menos
Nunca más volveré a depender de ti
Nunca
Nunca más volveré a besarte
Nunca más volveré a querer hacerlo
Nunca más volveré a quererte
Nunca!!!

Lying beside you.
Here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat
With mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love
Be so blind

We sailed on together 
We drifted apart
So here you are by my side

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
Here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms 

Living without you
Living alone

Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back 
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say

Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

My life has been full of mistakes and regrets for that I know
But without you I feel so cold
I'm an idiot for making the mistakes I did but will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me, my love please forgive me.

Coz since we've met
There is something in my life worth fighting for
God never thought I'd actually find it
But here it is
Here you are
Since we've met
I found myself more then I ever could of
God bless your soul, God bless your soul...

Your life I'm not to certain about the regrets I know of
But with you not here I can't see clear
You found me on that day tattered and ever so lonely
And gave me a little smirk

So please be with me, be with me. My love be with me.

Coz since we've met
There is something in my life worth fighting for
God never thought I'd actually find it
But here it is
Here you are
Since we've met

God bless your soul, God bless your soul...

What would I do without you?
Probably die.
What would I be without you?
A lonely soul
Guys have jerked me round before and I'm well over it but with you here you break my fall.

You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear

And now I'm stuck in the web
You're spinning
You've got me for your prey...

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

You're intruding in what's mine
You're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you please just let me be

Communication, telephonic invation
I'm planning my escape...

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

Now it's gone too deep
You wake me in my sleep
My dreams become nightmares
'Cause you're ringing in my ears

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message
And I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter, matter, matter, matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls



And the rockets' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave


Summer lovin' had me a blast 

Summer lovin'happened so fast 

I met a girl crazy for me 

Met a boy cute as can be 

Summer days driftin' away, to uh-oh those summer nights 

Uh Well-a well-a well-a huh 

Tell me more, tell me more 

Did you get very far? 

Tell me more, tell me more 

Like does he have a car? 

Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

She swam by me, she got a cramp 

He ran by me, got my suit damp 

I saved her life, she nearly drowned 

He showed off, splashing around 

Summer sun, something's begun, but uh-oh those summer nights 

Uh well-a well-a well-a huh 

Tell me more, tell me more 

Was it love at first sight? 

Tell me more, tell me more 

Did she put up a fight? 

Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh 

Took her bowling in the arcade 

We went strolling, drank lemonade 

We made out under the dock 

We stayed out 'till ten o'clock 

Summer fling, don't mean a thing, but uh-oh those summer nights 

Uh well-a well-a well-a huh 

Tell me more, tell me more 

But you don't gotta brag 

Tell me more, tell me more 

Cos he sounds like a drag 

shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop,shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, YEH 

He got friendly, holding my hand 

While she got friendly down in the sand 

He was sweet, just turned eighteen 

Well she was good you know what I mean 

Woah! 

Summer heat, boy and girl meet, but uh-oh those summer nights 

Woo, woo, woo 

Tell me more, tell me more 

How much dough did he spend? 

Tell me more, tell me more 

Could she get me a friend? 

It turned colder - that's where it ends 

So I told her we'd still be friends 

Then we made our true love vow 

Wonder what she's doing now 

Summer dreams ripped at the seams, 
bu-ut oh, those su-ummer nights.... 

Tell me more, tell me more! 

Is she sexy?

Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And i've tried
I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And im tired

As you break my heart again this time
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you're needing distance distance

Tell me everything but don't you say she's what you're missing baby
If she's the reason your leaving me here tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me
Tell me a lie.

You're the charming type
That little tweinke in your eye
Gets me every time
And well there must have been a time
I was a reason for that smile

So keep in mind

As you take whats left of you and I
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen listen

Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you're needing distance distance

Tell me everything but don't you say she's what you're missing baby
If she's the reason your leaving me here tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me
Tell me a lie.

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen listen

Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you're needing distance distance

Tell me everything but don't you say she's what you're missing baby
If she's the reason your leaving me here tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me
Tell me a lie.


What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?

Tell me what's this desperation
'Cuz I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I've loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart heart heart heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part part part)
Now everything is coming under

'Cuz you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apartt

I must admit the grass looks so much greener
On the other side
Since you left I notice now you're so much meaner
And it's something I think I like

Tell me whats this desperation
'Cuz I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I've loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart heart heart heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part part part)
Now everything is coming under


I was standin' with my friend 
When I saw you walkin' in 
And my heart started skippin' a beat 

I was tryin' to play it cool 
But I knew it was true 
That nobody would ever compete 

Well first comes love and then comes...

First date first kiss 
We were checkin' off the list 
Then you were gettin' down on your knee 

And you didn't have to guess 
It was a always a yes 
Now there's 2 less fish in the sea 

Let's set the date 
Let's hire a band 
Let's cut the cake 
Tie up the cans 
I love the ring of your name 
You're the ying to my yang 
Oh baby let's give it a shot 
Every wall needs a frame 
Every ball needs a chain 
I'm talkin' 'bout tying the knot 
Tie it up 

Something old, something new 
Something borrowed, something blue 
And the chairs lined up in the yard 

The I do's and the kisses 
From a Miss to a Misses 
Can't wait for forever to start 

Let's set the date 
Let's hire a band 
Let's cut the cake 
Tie up the cans 
I love the ring of your name 
You're the ying to my yang 
Oh baby let's give it a shot 
Every wall needs a frame 
Every ball needs a chain 
I'm talkin' 'bout tying the knot
Tie it up

Tie it up 
Invite the town 
Raise a glass and lock it down 
Tie it up 
Forever bound 
'Cause I'm fit to be tied down 

When Mama's kickin' off her shoes 
And Daddy's spinnin' from the booze 
And the last song is finally sung 

We can run to the room 
Kickstart the honeymoon 
Don't it sound like a whole lotta fun? 

Let's set the date 
Let's hire a band 
Let's cut the cake 
Tie up the cans 
I love the ring of your name 
You're the ying to my yang 
Oh baby let's give it a shot 
Every wall needs a frame 
Every ball needs a chain 
I'm talkin' 'bout tying the knot 
Tie it up

Tie you up

Tie it up



When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

Oohhhh ohhohh

The storms of rage are rolling wild and free
Down that highway of regret
The wind of change is blowing wild and free
But you aint seen nothing like me yet

There aint nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the end of the earth for you
Make you happy make your dreams come true
To make you feel my love

To make you feel my love


I went up to the mountains 
Because you asked me to 
Up over the clouds 
To were the sky was blue 
I can see all 'round me 
Everywere 
I could see around me 
Everywere 
Sometimes I feel like I'v been nothing but tired 
And i'll be working 'till the day I expire 
So sometimes I just lay down 
Lord what more can I do?  


But then go on again 
Because you asked me to 
Somedays I look down 
Afraid a-afraid I will fall 
And though the sun shines 
I see nothing at all 
But I hear your, your sweet voice
Oh, oh, ooo  
Coming and goin' 
Coming and goin' 
Lord telling me softly 
You love me so


I can't take the pressure of new
Gimme old, rip it off
Let's see if it sticks to the wall again

They're too dumb to see, see the truth
Give it to 'em, they will never notice
So what's stop, stop, stopping us

Does it sound familiar?
Does it linger in your ear?
Like something you remember from just last year?

Like sweet little lullabies in your ear?
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Hi, I'm originality

I'll be playing God and you can be my (b****)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit?
Wash, rinse, repeat
Why are you fighting it? (no, no, no)
Don't get crazy, keep between those lines (we love to)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Hi, my name is (censored) and I'm here to run everything
Spreading like a cancer, I will die and take you all with me
Let you have a little bit while secretly I'm waiting
To rip that rug from underneath, can't believe you fell for it

Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week
We will change a note and get away with it (wait and see)
Just when you think that we've changed, like an addict
We sweep right back in with a dose of reality

I'll be playing God and you can be my (b****)

The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit?
Wash, rinse, repeat
Why are you fighting it? (no, no, no)
Don't get crazy, keep between those lines (we love to)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat

The definition of insanity is to repeat the same thing, over and over, expecting a different result
I'm insane (I'm insane)
Just wash, rinse, and repeat

I'll be playing God and you can be my (b****)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit?
Wash, rinse, repeat
Why are you fighting it? (no, no, no)
Don't get crazy, keep between those lines (we love to)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

You love this song (everybody can do it)
This song is the most amazing song that you have ever heard (it's easy)

You said you'd be here
Well, I've been waiting way too long now
And still there's no sound of you in the distance
If you're even coming, I'm through praying
I keep getting guys busy line

You said you'd be here
But don't worry, baby
You're not the first disappeared

Where are you now? Where are you now?
Just when I crumble, now that I'm falling down
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Now that I need you the most
Just when I thought I was home

Well, I've gotten used to it, I don't ever miss you
Can't remember why I've been crying
I don't feel it anymore
I'm so used to seeing that damn dark clouds

Where are you now? Where are you now?
Just when I crumble, now that I'm falling down
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Now that I need you the most

All your letters and all your kisses
And all your words, they don't mean anything
All my thoughts and all the time we spent
All those memories, I'm erasing

With all my heart and soul
I'm all out of hope
I guess I'm through lying to myself

'Cause you said you'd be here
I'm looking around
And you're nowhere near, baby

Where are you now? Where are you now?
Just when I crumble, now that I'm falling down
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Now that I need you the most

You're holding somebody else
Just when I thought I was home


(kelly)
sitting all alone
on the porch waiting
for you to come around but
you don't oooh yeah. and then
I remember that you are gone yeahh.

(Chours)(Kelly)
Where is the feeling that
I used to know when would make love.
where is the feeling we used to know and
than I wonder where did the feeling go.

(kalan)
I think of you all
the time even if the feeling
is there or not but I hope you that
the feeling is still there for me
but I just can't wait for you to come
around. But still where did the feeling go.

(Chours)
Where is the feeling that
I used to know when would make love.
where is the feeling we used to know and
than I wonder where did the feeling go.


Where is the feeling that
I used to know when would make love.
where is the feeling we used to know and
than I wonder where did the feeling go.

(Kelly)

(kelly&Kalan)

I had to spend alone but know that
you are back I realized that the feeling
is gone and I still I'm wondering ohhh wondering where did it go.

(Chours)
Where is the feeling that(Where Did It go)
I used to know when would make love.

than I wonder where did the feeling go.

(Kelly)
Ohh will we ever find the
feeling again. oooh

[Kelly]

your near. But then again your 
heart can play so many tricks on 
you but I still wish that I could 
be 

[Chours: Both] 
Where you are 
Where we had danced toghether 
Where you are 
will be kissing under the stars 
tonight only than will I be where 
you are. 


[Kalan] 
and I can see your face but 
it hurts everytime I do cause you 
my love .... 

[Chours: Both] 
Where you are 
Where we had danced toghether 
Where you are 
will be kissing under the stars 
tonight only than will I be where 
you are.


There were places we would go at midnight. 
There were secrets that nobody else would know. 
There a reason but I don't know why 
I don't know why 
I don't know why 
I thought they all belong to me.
Who's that girl?
Where's she from?
No she can't be the one!
That you want!
That has stolen my world.
It's not real! 
It's not right!
It's my day! 
It's my night!
By the way, who's that girl...living my life?  
Oh no. 
Living my life.
Seems like everythings the same.
Around me.
Then I look and everything has changed.
I'm not dreaming so I don't know why 
I don't know why 
I don't know why.
She's everywhere I wan't to be! 
Who's that girl?
Where's she from? 
No she can't be the one!
That you want!
That has stolen my world. 
It's not real!it's not right!
It's my day! 
It's my night! 
By the way who's that girl...living my life? 
I'm the one who made you laugh.
I made you feel I made you sad.
I'm not sorry, for what we did, for who we were, I'm not sorry I'm not her.
Who's that girl? 
Where's she from?
No she can't be the one!
That you wan't!
That has stolen my world.
It's not real!
It's not right!
It's my day!
It's my night!
By the way..Who's that girl...living my life?
Oh no.
Living my life.


Every night I pray
That the ghost in your head will just fade away
All the ways I have tried to get in 
I keep thinking I could break 'em down
All the walls in your heart would fall to the ground
But there are moments you look at me now and I wonder

Who, who, whoever loved you like that
Who, who, whoever broke your wings
I see you're hurtin' and where you got burned 
But whoever did that wasn't me

Without any words slowly you move away
Without anything left for me left to say
Where'd you go
I've been holding on to little things
All these pieces of you I've been saving
Hoping one day I won't have to hold so tightly

Who, who, whoever loved you like that
Who, who, whoever broke your wings
I see you're hurtin' and where you got burned 
But whoever did that wasn't me

If you cry I will too
When you call I won't walk I will run to you
If you ever lose sight of my love I won't hide 
I'll find you

Cause who, who, whoever loved you like that
Who, who, whoever broke your wings
I see you're hurtin' and where you got burned 
But whoever did that wasn't me

Yeah whoever did that wasn't me


Drawing hearts on the foggy glass
New love chase away my past
Nothing but the open road
Saddle up
Here we go...
1,2,3

First winter here in your arms
Flames rising as well fall like stars
Making angels in the snow
Warm, fuzzies, frozen toes...
Is this a dream?

Don't Wake me up
If this is love
Please let me be
Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream
Winter dream
Winter dream

Build a fire to escape the cold
Bing Crosby on the stereo
Tracing letters on my skin
Slowly starts sinkin' in...
You love me

Oh, Don't Wake me up
If this is love
Please let me be
Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter

Dream and dreams
While I'm wide awake
The tree, the lights
Stayin' up late
It's true...
I'm in love with you

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve
"I" became "we"
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream, dream
Winter dream


When you hit the bottom
When you're left with nothing
When you can't tell the difference, yeah
You still won't know what it's like

When you think you're drowning
When it's overwhelming
When you can't get past it, yeah
You still won't know what it's like
What it's like

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen
You haven't lived enough to know what it means
To feel the pain in love turned cold
To taste the year before it's over

When your body's frozen
And you can trust no one
When you think you're lonely, yeah
You still won't know what it's like

When you feel the knife stick
You just can't take it
When your heart is breaking
You still won't know what it's like
What it's like

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen
You haven't lived enough to know what it means

To feel the pain in love turned cold
To taste the end before it's over

You don't know the first thing of suffering
So before you start trading stocks for sympathies
Take a look at what's left of me
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me

Every day I fight a war with God
And every time I think I'm living a lie,
No I'm not

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen
You haven't lived enough to know what it means
To feel the pain in love turned cold
To taste the year before it's over

You don't know the first thing of suffering
So before you start trading stock for sympathy
Take a look at what's left of me
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me

You don't know the first thing of suffering
So before you start trading stock for sympathy
Take a look at what's left of me
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me


Come stop your crying
It will be all right
Just take my hand
Hold it tight

I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small,
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you,
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart, always

Why can't they understand
The way we feel
They just don't trust
What they can't explain
I know we're different but,
Deep in side us

We're not that different at all

And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other,
To have, to hold
They'll see in time
I know

When destiny calls you
You must be strong
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever

Oh, you'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart, always
Always

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, ooh

Baby, I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

Everybody throw your hands up.


''Baby, I know you're hurting. Right now you feel like you could never love again. Now all I ask is for a chance to prove that I love you.''

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out
You said no, but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by, you will get to know me
A little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
And I understand
But girl, it's time to let go

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see?

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
No way, no how
I'll never make you cry
Oh I, oh I, I swear
No way, no how
Honey I swear, 'cause I know how

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie


Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
Quit playin' games

Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh, baby, baby, this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

Baby
Quit playin' games

Nanana...

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Nanana...

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart


Ooh

You've got something
So incredible in my eyes
My heart starts pumpin
Whenever you're around
My whole world's upside down
Baby

But I try to get closer
And you always push me away
You tell me it's much too soon
But I just can't help it
I always gotta make a play

Ooh

Boys will be boys
(Hey)

As long as you love me

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't care)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from (I don't care)
As long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (You love me)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me (You love me)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from
What did you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from (Where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me


I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart? 
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not 
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you 

Hey girl ''(Hey girl)''
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Ohh, all the money in the world 
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Ohh, everything I have is for you
You got what I need (You, you, you, you...)

Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were
Oh what a lie
Once we were dreamers
Just dreamers we were
Both you and I

Now I see you're just somebody
Who wastes all my time
And money
What a lie
You and I

What about your
Your ten thousand promises
That you gave to me
Your ten thousand promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the promises
Turned out to be all lies

Now...
Now I see I'm just somebody
Who wasted my time and money
What a lie (what a lie)
You and I (you and I)

What about your
Your ten thousand promises
That you gave to me
Your ten thousand promises
That you promised me

You say I'll take you back
But I closed the door
Cuz I don't want
Ten thousand more

Ten thousand promises yeah
Ten thousand promises you gave to me

What about your
Your ten thousand promises
That you gave to me
Your ten thousand promises
That you promised me

Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were
Oh, you and I
What a lie


If I could right the wrongs that made you cry
Girl would you  promise not to say good-bye
Cause I'm holding on
With A Love so strong
And I can't take the day without you by my side

Girl If I could change
If I could change your mind
Maybe you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes

Girl Don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me
So I'm pressin' on
I hope you understand
That there's a broken heart that lies within your hands

So If I could change (So if i could change)
And it won't hurt your pride (and it wont hurt your pride)
Baby you can help me stop these tears from my cries

Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile (your pretty smile)
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Like a child
Just like a child
With her spirit running free
She drove me wild
Oh, she did

Like a child (oh baby)
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile
And If you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child


Aah, Backstreet
Yes yes y'all
One time, here we go (yes yes y'all)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yes yes y'all

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me (leading me) to you (to you)
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (yes yes y'all)
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And just imagine this alone
Let the music put you in a zone
Are you lost in, lost inside of, lost inside of me
Why do you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body

Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Keep it coming Mr. DJ... (repeat to fade)


Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada dadadadada
(On memory's bliss of you)
Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada (oh) dadadadada

The candle plays the hour glass days go
And all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night 
I remember everything
Every smile, even all the reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my mind

Baby you send me,
baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny in everything
Reality has replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life
I bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there
Just give me time
To fix my life
baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I spent wishing

Baby you send me,
baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind fights carelessly imagine
you are happy with your life right now , oh ...
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone
So now I must place you with all the things
That I could never have

Baby you send me, baby you send me,
baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss
Send me, you send me,
Come on now
I know this love is true
I know this love is true

Everyday, girl I wake up and pray
That you'll come back home and don't take too long
Cuz since you've been gone, everything's gone horribly wrong

You know I'd go out of my mind if you ever left my heart behind
So I'm begging you please bring your sweet love back to me
(Please come back to me)

Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet

Been checking up the places where we used to go
And looking for your face inside the crowd
I've been talking to the people that we used to know
But nobody wants to say where you hang out

And when I call your phone
Seems like you're never, ever home
And you don't return my calls
It tears me up
This breaking of my heart

Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet

I still have your pictures hung around my room
They're the only thing that's left of you and me
Girl, what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way It used to be

Oh is it someone new
Can never go on without you
Girl I don't wanna think about it
I can't sleep at night
No this can't be right
Come back into my life (come back, baby come back)

Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet

I know there's a chance for you and I
And I believe there's no way our love could die
So no matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you
And whatever it takes, I'll be there for you
I'll be there
I'll be there

Oh baby I'm missing you
We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby I'm missing you
They say I'll learn to forget
But It sure ain't happen yet

Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start

Quit playin' games

Don't leave me hangin' here forever

As long as you love me

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't care)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from (I don't care)
As long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (You love me)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me (You love me)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from
What did you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from (Where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me

I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart? 
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not 
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you 

Hey girl ''(Hey girl)''
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Ohh, all the money in the world 
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Ohh, everything I have is for you
You got what I need (You, you, you, you...)
What I need
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
My love is all...

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live ''(I don't think that I can live)''
I wish I could give the world to you ''(I wanna give the world to you)''
But love is all I have to give ''(It's all that I have)''

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
To you

Ohh...
All I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you, lady
But love is all I have to give ''(That's all I got to give)''

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live ''(I don't think that I can live)''
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give


I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, ooh
Hey baby, hey baby

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you
For you


Aah, Backstreet
Yes yes y'all
One time, here we go (yes yes y'all)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yes yes y'all

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me (leading me) to you (to you)
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (yes yes y'all)
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside you world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And just imagine this alone
Let the music put you in a zone
Are you lost in, lost inside of, lost inside of me
Why do you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body

Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?

Keep it coming Mr. DJ... (repeat to fade)


''Baby, I know you're hurting. Right now you feel like you could never love again. Now all I ask is for a chance to prove that I love you.''

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out
You said no, but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by, you will get to know me
A little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
And I understand
But girl, it's time to let go

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see?

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

I'll never break your heart
No way, no how
I'll never make you cry
Oh I, oh I, I swear
No way, no how
Honey I swear, 'cause I know how

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie


Baby, can I talk to you
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back again
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
Or come as a friend to me
Tell me why would you turn away from my love

So darlin' 
Tell me what to do to make things right 
Darlin' 
Tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things rigth
For love
(Tell me what to do to make things right)
(for love)

If your words have reasons
Then they won't turn away from me
Trying hard to hide all truth that you might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Then maybe,
You wouldn't shut me
Out of your life, baby

So darlin' 
Tell me what to do to make things right 
Darlin' 
Tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things rigth
For love

All I'm asking for is a chance
To let me love you

Girl you know,
With me is where you should be
And if by chance we should find
That it can be for you and I
Then girl I've tried
I've tried, oh baby

So darlin' 
Tell me what to do to make things right 
Darlin' 
Tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things rigth
For love
(Tell me what to do to make things right)
(for love)

Give anything for your love 
Tell me how can I make you mine

Girl you should know how I feel by now
There are so many ways to love
So just open your heart
And I'll find a way

(Can't you see)
All I'm asking for is a chance
To let me love you
(Can't you see)
Girl you know,
This is where you should be, ooh,
And if by chance that we should find
That it can be for you and I
Then girl I've tried
I've tried, oh baby

Yo, and get your body swinging

Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada dadadadada
(On memory's bliss of you)
Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada (oh) dadadadada

The candle plays the hour glass days go
And all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night 
I remember everything
Every smile, even all the reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my mind

Baby you send me,
baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny in everything
Reality has replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life
I bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there
Just give me time
To fix my life
baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I spent wishing

Baby you send me,
baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind fights carelessly imagine
you are happy with your life right now , oh ...
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone
So now I must place you with all the things
That I could never have

Baby you send me, baby you send me,
baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss
Send me, you send me,
Come on now
I know this love is true
I know this love is true

I may run and hide when you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now, there are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Larger than life

Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe, when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire?
Your one desire?
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are
Don't wanna hear you say

Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(I wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say
Oh yeah
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why

Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to believe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love ''(Endless love)''
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? ''(Tell me why)''
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? ''(Tell me why)''
Tell me why I can't be there where you are ''(Where you are)''
There's something missing in my heart ''(You are missing in my heart)''

Show me the meaning of being lonely ''(Being lonely)''
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? ''(Tell me why)''
Tell me why I can't be there where you are ''(Can't be there where you are)''
There's something missing in my heart

Don't... don't want you back

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe

But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't... don't want you back

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I,I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize(realize)
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I,I don't want you back

(Baaaaaaaack a no no!)
I, I don't want you back

That's right

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't want you back
That's all I know
Don't want you back
All I can say
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go

Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know (don't want you back x2)
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I,I don't want you back


I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't wanna lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No no, or ever again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to leave that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

Don't wanna lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No no, or ever again

I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you
Don't want to lose to loneliness
Girl I know we can win
Don't want to lose to emptiness, oh no
Never again

Don't wanna lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No no, or ever again


I'll be the one 

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more them mysteries and lies

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one ''(I'll be the one)''
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light ''(I'll be the light)''
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you 
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one ''(I'll be the one)''
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light ''(I'll be the light)''
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright

You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, baby please

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run

I'll be the one ''(I'll be the one)''
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light ''(I'll be the light)''
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it all right
I'll be the one 
To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright
I'll be the one


It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life

The road to take
To find a way back to your heart

Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is right
for us tonight

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart and in my mind,
when all I could find

When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distant star
I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes


When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch, come between
the two of us

'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday I love you girl in
every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

Damn i love you


It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would
always be there
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

'Cause mom you always were,
mom you always were
Mom you always were,
you know you always were'
Cause mom you always were... the perfect fan

I love you mom


Don't say a word.

When I first met you my life turned a page
Chapter one was how true love was made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I'd missed

You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl when you touch me
I began to understand (Ohhh)

You, you wrote the book on love
And I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh you, you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love

(Oh Brian help me sing)

Each time I hold you
I find something new
'Cause I know what I love about you baby
Girl I discovered
You bring out the lover in me (yeah, yeah)
Your like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano I'm ready to blow
'Cause everytime I look at you I feel
Love I can't explain (ohhh)

You, you wrote the book on love
And I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh you, you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love

I hear what your heart is saying to me
I see the picture so clearly
I'm thirsty for the knowledge true love brings, baby
When you're near me

You wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book

Oh you, you wrote the book on love
And I wanna read every word
'Cause you, babe you wrote the book

Oh you, you wrote the book on love
Girl I just can't get enough of your love
I know you wrote the book on love

You wrote the book on love

7AM...thinking 'bout you
Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling, you're feeling too
Like a new born child - soft to the touch
Baby is it possible to love someone so much?
(mm, mmm)

I wish I may,
I wish I might
Be that certain someone
You wish for every night

If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
(my lady, yes my lady)
If you knew what I knew

(ahh, ahhh, ahhh .ahhhhh-ahhhhh, aaahhhhhhhhh)

Time passes by
The only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion and fears I have inside
Like a lost soul...I feel like I'm all alone
(all alone)
If only I could feel your pain within your heart of stone...

I wish I may,
I wish I might
Be that certain someone
You wish for everynight

If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
If you knew what I knew

Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
(oooo..)
Then you would be here...to stay
(...alll)
Right by my side
( ways)
Always

If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
(my lady, yes my lady)

If you knew what I knew my baby,
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead
If you knew what I knew my baby,
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead

Girl I miss you
And it's only been one day
Since I went away
And all ready I say
I long to kiss you
And hold you in my arms
The nights are much too long
When you're gone

Baby that's why
Wherever I go
Girl my heart stays with you
After every show
I wanna rush over to you

How one of us

Cause I can feel you too
No matter what you do I think of you

Girl my heart stays with you
I wanna rush over to you
Baby yeah, when I'm leaving town
Girl, it hurts me too
But I've got a job to do

I'll be back around
To feel your sweet face
Your embrace
No one can take your place
I want you to know

I'm rushing over to you
Wherever I go whatever I do
Girl my heart, I know my heart stays with you

Wherever I go whatever I do
Girl my heart, I know my heart stays with you
How one of us

Wherever I go whatever I do
Girl my heart, I know my heart stays with you.


(''Phone Rings'')
(''Phone Pick-up'')
''"Hello?"
"Hi, it's me, what's up baby? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Wait, wait, say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really droppin' out, I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me, we're goin' to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"''
(''Phone Hang-up'')

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said, "No, someone's waiting for me..."
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry (''"Hello...?"'')
Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry (''"Hello...?"'')
Gotta go...

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go...!

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
We're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"


Hmm, yeah yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now, don't bother 
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me 
From the man that I've become, oh yeah

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So, help me 
I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother 
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me
From the man I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the true shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of
Show you the shape of my heart

You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come, but you know that it's not too late
There's been to many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To face our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start a new

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life

Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line

The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign

I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying?
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never?
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end 

And I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say

Hey, there's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that

Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say

I know that I, I can't believe
Just what the past has brought me
To the man  I wanna be
And I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go
I know we have changed but,
Change can be so good
So let's not forget why it's understood that

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

I remember when mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days, that we would sing at
The drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered
Oh, I know we've changed but,
Change can be so good
Oh, so let's not forget why it's understood that

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

So here we are
And we'll always stay together
And through it all you know
We owe it all to you, you, you and you
(Time goes on, never stops, it keeps on)

Time
Look where we are
And what we've been through
Time
Sharin' our dreams (sharin' little, little life with you)
Time (goes on) goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is come what may

Time
Look where we are

I was looking for something
On a crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with his number
It's just another clue (that leads to you)
I got a little suspicious, I got a feeling
That you ain't true to me
I should have known better than to buy your lies (your sweet disguise)
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me, babe

No no uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No no uh uh
And now I know what it's coming to
No no uh uh
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

I don't wanna be part of your screenplay
Just tell me did you rehearse on me?
Just give me the story
Baby who's to win? Me or him?
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of Hide and Seek
I'm getting the feeling that it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see
That you're not for me, baby

No no uh uh (yeah yeah)
Things will never be the same again with you
No no uh uh (Oh)
And now I know what it's coming to

'Cause if you think that it's the way that love, should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

Yeah, yeah
I said no, no
No way
No no, no no
No

I had enough of your talk, your games
And it won't go away (won't go away)
Justify my reasons to say (say.. reasons to say)

No no uh uh
Let me hear you say No no
No no uh uh
No no, let me tell you it's not for me
I said No no
No no uh uh
'Cause if you think that it's the way that love should be

Even the  lovers makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again?

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me
Maybe your faith is gone, but is it?
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again, oh yeah

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it's true
Without you I would fall apart

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it' true
Without you I would fall apart

Oh...
Oh yeah...
It's true.......


Remember when, we never needed each other
The best of friends like sister and brother
We understood we'd never be alone

Those days are gone 
Now I want you so much
The night is long 
and I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't wanna be alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Fallen so hard, so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice and I start to tremble
Brings back the child that I resemble
I cannot pretend that we can still be friends
Don't wanna be alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Fallen so hard, so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

Ooh I wanna say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know
I don't wanna live this life
I don't wanna say goodbye
With you I wanna spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Fallen so hard, so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Fallen so hard, so fast this time
Everything's changed, we never knew
How did I fall in love with you?


You don't run with the crowd
You go your own way
You don't play after dark
You light up my day
Got your own kind of style
That sets you apart
Baby that's why you captured my heart
I know sometimes you feel
Like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know
What you have within
When I look at you
I see something rare
A rose that can grow anywhere

And there's no one I know that can compare

What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(you're all I need oh girl)
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me

You got something so real
You touched me so deep
See, material things don't matter to me
So come as you are, you got nothing to prove
You won me with all that you do
And I wanna take this chance to say to you

What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(you're all I need oh girl)
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful...

You don't know how you touched my life
Oh in so many ways I just can't describe
You taught me what love is supposed to be
it's all the little things that make you beautiful to me
So beautiful...

What makes you...

What makes you different makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
(you're all I need oh girl)
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me

Everything in you is beautiful
Love you give shines right to me
Everything in you is beautiful
Beautiful to me
To me...


Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe, when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire?
Your one desire?
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are
Don't wanna hear you say

Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Oh yeah
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

As long as you love me

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't care)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from (I don't care)
As long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (You love me)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me (You love me)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from
What did you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from (Where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me


Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to believe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love ''(Endless love)''
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? ''(Tell me why)''
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show?

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? ''(Tell me why)''
Tell me why I can't be there where you are ''(Where you are)''
There's something missing in my heart ''(You are missing in my heart)''

Show me the meaning of being lonely ''(Being lonely)''
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? ''(Tell me why)''
Tell me why I can't be there where you are ''(Can't be there where you are)''
There's something missing in my heart


Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
Quit playin' games

Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh, baby, baby, this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

Baby
Quit playin' games

Nanana...

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Nanana...

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart


I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart? 
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not 
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you 

Hey girl ''(Hey girl)''
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Ohh, all the money in the world 
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Ohh, everything I have is for you
You got what I need (You, you, you, you...)
What I need
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
My love is all...

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live ''(I don't think that I can live)''
I wish I could give the world to you ''(I wanna give the world to you)''
But love is all I have to give ''(It's all that I have)''

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
To you

Ohh...
All I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you, lady
But love is all I have to give ''(That's all I got to give)''

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live ''(I don't think that I can live)''
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give


I may run and hide when you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now, there are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right

''Baby, I know you're hurting. Right now you feel like you could never love again. Now all I ask is for a chance to prove that I love you.''

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out
You said no, but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by, you will get to know me
A little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
And I understand
But girl, it's time to let go

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

(''Phone Rings'')
(''Phone Pick-up'')
''"Hello?"
"Hi, it's me, what's up baby? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Wait, wait, say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really droppin' out, I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me, we're goin' to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"''
(''Phone Hang-up'')

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said, "No, someone's waiting for me..."
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry (''"Hello...?"'')
Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry (''"Hello...?"'')
Gotta go...

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go...!

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
We're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"


Hmm, yeah yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now, don't bother 
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me 
From the man that I've become, oh yeah

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So, help me 
I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother 
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me
From the man I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more

But to show you the shape of my heart

Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the true shape of my heart

I'll be the one 

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more them mysteries and lies

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one ''(I'll be the one)''
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light ''(I'll be the light)''
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you 
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one ''(I'll be the one)''
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light ''(I'll be the light)''
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright

You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, baby please

I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright

To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright

I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying?
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never?
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end 

And I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say

Hey, there's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that


Ohh
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power 
To make me weak inside
And girl, you leave me breathless
But it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough

'Cause everytime I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
'Cause I have known the safety
Of floating freely in your arms
I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me
'Cause only you can save me
Oh, can't you see?

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough

'Cause everytime I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth-to-mouth now
You know I can't resist
'Cause you're the air that I breathe

Everytime I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
Ohh, got me drowning
Keep me drowning in your love
Baby, I can't help it 
I can't help it, can't help it, no no

Everytime I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love


Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go (Alone...)

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete
Incomplete



Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do
Could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (yeah)
I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing, I try to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away

And I just want you to know ('cause I can't fight it)
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through (and then there's)
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (I have to say, I)
I would do it all again

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe (yeah)
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (but still I have to say)
No, I would do it all again
Just want you to know


Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
Baby I was wrong
Yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

I know you're in there and you can make me wait
But I'm not gonna wait
It's the least that I can do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad, I can't blame you for being mad
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You will see a different man

But baby here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you (come on)
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you

Banging on your front door (darling)
My pride spilled on the floor
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you, yeah
Now I'm crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you


Weird world, weird world
Hey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down
You see I've got to catch a plane, won't buy a ticket
Cause it's hard to stop when you're spinning around

It's a weird world don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a GI in the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you
Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
Hey hey hey


Who are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

No no
Wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (without you)

Though everything's been said and done (yeah)
I still feel you (I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from you


Yeah, yeah, yeah

Julie was a long way from home
She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made her part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

She said, "What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wanna believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right-now poster girl

Right now, right now
Oooh... (ow-oh...)

Julie liked to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor 'til the camera made us
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
Where she'd walk I followed (followed)
When she left I cried

What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
And I was wrapped around her finger
And I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right-now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right-now poster girl

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la (la la la la la)
La la la la
La la la la (la la la la)
La la la la la

Oh
Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences (poster girl) of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now, right now
Right now, oh oh
Poster girl, poster girl
Poster girl yeah
Come on, come on yeah


Oh no
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

Don't change a thing, perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway


Close your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside (oh yeah)
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss (ohh)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way?
If I can't have you
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now (now)
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss

Ohhhh
I can't let you go no

And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (ohh ohh)
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss (I miss) you


How can I begin to
Tell you what you do to
Me every time I hear ya
More willing to wanna see ya

I know that there's no use in
Tryin' to explain the confusion
But still I'm not complainin'
'Bout my situation

Let's not talk about a
Possible ending

The very first time that I
Was lookin' to be your fella
I found my inspiration
Hidin' in your expression
So I put myself forward
For your consideration

Let's not talk about a
Possible ending
Let's not think about it
Every day
And I know
I'm so
In love
With you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
Every time I hear
My beautiful woman

And so we put the top down
To take you drivin' downtown
I guess we'll know just what to do
When you're lookin' to fool around

It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down

Let's not talk about a
Possible ending
Let's not think about it
Every day
And I know
I'm so
In love
With you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
Every time I hear
My beautiful woman

My beautiful woman
My beautiful woman
My beautiful woman

B is for beautiful
As the sunshine
E tells me everything is feelin' alright
A goes to you and me swingin' it down
T is two
I want you, You've got me actin' like a
Fool


Yeah, yeah
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do"
And after all this time my heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone

I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

Can you see me, here I am
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart I still find
You're my safest place to hide

You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming

When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to go
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home

Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart I'd still find
You're my safest place to hide
My safest place to hide

I know I promised you forever
There's no stronger word I can use
To reassure when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

Oh! Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart I'd still find
Yeah, yeah
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah
You're my safest place to hide


When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too


The things we did, the things we said
Keep comin' back to me and make me smile again
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything that's good in me I owe to you

Though the distance that's between us
Now may seem to be too far
It will never separate us
Deep inside, I know you are

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye
I know you would be forever in my life (yeah)
Never gone

No, no, no, no

I walk along these empty streets
There is not a second you're not here with me
The love you gave, the grace you've shown
Will always give me strength and be my cornerstone

(Somehow) somehow you found a way
To see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on
I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close (always close), everyday (everyday yeah)
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye
I know you would be forever in my life (in my life, yeah)

Never gone (gone from me)
If there's one thing I believe (I believe)
I will see you somewhere down the road again
(I will see you somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere)

(Never gone) Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close (always close, always close), everyday (everyday, everyday)
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye (yeah, yeah)
I know you would be forever in my life

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are (in my heart is where you are)
Always close (always close), everyday (everyday)
Every step along the way

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are


Hey.. 

This one is for the mothers 
Who've lost a child 
This one is for the gipsys 
Who left their hearts behind 
This is for the strangers 
Sleeping in my heart 
Take what they want 
And leave while it's still dark 

No one is glamourously
Lonely, all by themselves 

This is a song for the unloved 
This is a music for one last cry 
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved) 

This one's for the bridesmaid 
Never the bride 
This one's for the dreamers 
Who locked their faith inside 
This is for the widows 
Who think there's only one 
The dying fathers that never told their sons 

No one is glamourously, lonely 
Follow your heart 

This is a song for the unloved 
This is a music for one last cry 
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved) 

Ohh 
Tomorrow the sun will shine 
And dry the tears in your eyes 
Suddenly love comes alive 

For one last cry 

This is a song for the unloved 
This is a music for one last cry 
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved) 

This is a song for the unloved 
This is a music for one last cry 
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved)

Only one life to live in
We're trying our best to make it through
There're no mistakes just lessons
It's all about what they mean to you

So just get to Movin' On
We're movin' on
We're movin' on
Living day by day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
Movin on

Gotta take a chance while we can
To find our place in our world
We had to understand the plan

Put the past behind you and
Pick up the pieces move on with your life

You can look at yourself and see the truth
Realize it takes time to become you

So just get to Movin' On

Living day by day by day everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same

Movin on


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Its 3 am, I can't sleep
Too late to call this is not like me
But I'm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back
The angle of your chin when you were looking back

See, god you're beautiful and I'm still coming down
I'd like a one-night stand, but you had to stick around
But I'm still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets
I haven't changed a thing since you abandoned me

Tonight I stare out the window
Knowing I'll never again be alone

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life
Last night you saved my life

Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It's like I knew you all my life even though we just met
My children in your eyes, something you don't expect


I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I'm glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life with your love

Last night you saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life

Ohh yeah

I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Can't wait to tell you you're the only one
Last night you saved my life

And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you changed my life


Jam

s-To do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Everybody on to the floor
Good job, baby

I saw you pull to the back
And roll with the cream in the back
I look at you, you look right back
Like you wanna get funky

I hit the bar to buy you a drink
Feel you out to see how you think
It's do or die, I'ma swim or sink
Cause I wanna get funky

I love the way you move
Can't wait to get you on the floor 'cause
You got that body baby
I came to ask you for this dance, girl

Chorus:
Let's set it off (oh, show me what you got)
Let's set it off (baby let's dance girl)
Dance
Let's set it off (can't let you leave)
Can't let you leave until we dance girl
Let's set it off (oh, show me what you got)
Let's set it off (baby let's dance)
Let's set it off (wanna feel that fire)
Cause there'll be fire when we dance

Hold up, it's not about sex
It's all about the vibe and the mix
You and me, one with the kick drum
Don't you wanna get funky?

I can't cry no more
Girl, my eyes are empty 
Can't think of nothing but you 
You are the reason I wake up in the morning 
Lately I'm sleeping till two

Sometimes I swear that you are lying here beside me 
I reach for you girl and you're not there 
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow 
Still finding strings of your hair 

Tell me can we try baby
Can we get back to love again
Seems like I'm losing my best friend 
Can you rescue me from the rain 
And be my sunshine again 
Can I make it up to you 
I promise that I'll do anything for us 
Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you 
Let's go back to love again 

I don't wanna go on without you, baby
Don't wanna hurt anymore 
Ain't nothing right and my world is going crazy 
Ain't nothing left to live for

And I try but I
Can't stop loving you wishing you were here,
Baby you are my life
I just want my baby girl 

So can we get back to love again 
Seems like I'm losing my best friend 
Can you rescue me from the rain 
And be my sunshine again 
Can I make it up to you 
I promise that I'll do anything for us 
Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you 
Let's get back to love again 

Give me one more night to change your mind 
And girl I swear tonight will be the night I'm gonna take you there 
I have to risk my last chance girl 
I don't care if I die trying to get you back, baby
I love you, you are my lady
I'll be there daily, weekly 

Can we get back to love again 
Seems like I'm losing my best friend 
Can you rescue me from the rain 
And be my sunshine again 
Can I make it up to you 
I promise that I'll do anything for us 
Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you
Let's get back to love again

Can we get back to love again 
Seems like I'm losing my best friend 
Can you rescue me from the rain 
And be my sunshine again 
Can I make it up to you 
I promise that I'll do anything for us 
Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you
Let's get back to love again



All In This Together

Let me tell you what I see through my eyes 
Apathy is all around and on the rise 
We channel so much energy through our greed 
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need 
Lemme tell you 

Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 

It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools 
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do 
We compromise our liberties for security 
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see 
Lemme tell you 

Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 

Don't throw in the towel 
Let's overcome the test for now 
Together (together) we last, divided we fall 
Love will conquer all 

Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you)
Living is more than profits accrued
(We gotta change, we gotta change right now)
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 

Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together


Yeah, Oh, Oh Yeah yeah.

Once there was a time,
love was just a myth,
it just wasn't for real,
it didn't exist.
Until the day you came into my life,
it forced me to think twice.
I didn't have too much,
no I wasn't rich,
You made me believe someday,
I'd be more than this.
That's why until this day I'm still your man,
cause you made me understand...

Love is,
kisses in a bean bag chair
the two of us with no one there
Love is,
the moment that I climb the stairs
to hold you in my arms after we made love.
Love is,
waking up to see your face,
or kissing in the morning rain.
The only thing that keeps me sane,
at the end of the day is that I've got you.

You're my secret place,
where I can be myself.
You connect with me,
like nobody else.
Even though our circumstances changed,
our love still remains.
Keep me on the ground,
still you help me fly,
You taught me to be patient,
I taught you to rely,
so no matter what tomorrow brings,
we got the simple things cause...

Love is,
kisses in a bean bag chair
the two of us with no one there
Love is,
the moment that I climb the stairs
to hold you in my arms after we made love.
Love is,
waking up to see your face,
or kissing in the morning rain.
The only thing that keeps me sane,
is at the end of the day I've got you.

Love is,
a Sunday morning with the blanket wrapped around your waist.
Love is,
the way your lips seems to curve when you say my name.
Love is,
and when I'm stressing like the world's turnin' upside down.
girl it all makes sense when you're around.

Love is,
kisses in a bean bag chair
the two of us with no one there
Love is,
the moment that I climb the stairs
to hold you in my arms after we made love.
Love is,
waking up to see your face,
or kissing in the morning rain.
The only thing that keeps me sane,
is at the end of the day I've got you.

Love is,
kisses in a bean bag chair
the two of us with no one there
Love is,
the moment that I climb the stairs
to hold you in my arms after we made love.
Love is,
waking up to see your face,
or kissing in the morning rain.
The only thing that keeps me sane,
is at the end of the day I've got you. 


Brothers fighting brothers
Lovers fighting lovers
People barely caring anymore
Nations hating nations
Love is lost in the equation
Wondering why there is still so many wars

It's like this whole world's caught in
Some crazy storm

We could use some divine intervention
God, if you're listening, won't you help us
Find a solution to all this confusion

Lives in desperation
A world of devestation
No one knowing where it's gonna go
We got too many too hungry
It's time to stop this suffering
And I don't think we can do it on our own

And right now we need something
To save our souls

We could use some divine intervention
God, if you're listening, won't you help us
Find a solution to all this confusion (we sure could use some)

Show us that our change is gonna come
Help us to replace the hate with love
Overflow our hearts with kindness
Help us lift the clouds out of our way

We could use some divine intervention
God, if you're listening, won't you help us (yes, God are you listening)
Find a solution to all this confusion

Gotta find a way (X5)

God, if you're listening, won't you help us?


You know I been trying to figure out
Just what's going on
Am I over her?
I been doing a lot of thinking lately
Am I over her?
And I'm really missing you

It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days
Since the last time I seen your pretty face
My decision to bring this to an end
And I'm caught up in reminscing
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks
Play fights, late nights
It's been on my mind since Valentine's
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide

I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)

Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

I was going through some things that I couldn't explain
Now my situation's taking a big change
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around
Is she sad or is she mad?
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone

I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)

Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

It's water under the bridge
But I can't seem to forget


All the plans we made, all the time we spent
Makes me reminisce
I still see your face
All this love I can't replace
Am I over (am I over)
Am I over her? (her now)

Am I over her?
Am I over her? (am I)
Am I over her? (am I over)
Tell me am I really over my my love (my love my love)
I can't think straight (my love)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (never gonna be over her)
Am I really over my love? (never gonna be)

No
Am I over her?
No not over her no
Ohhhhhh
Am I over her?

Am I over her? (over her)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her, am I over her?)
I can't think straight (I'm not over her)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love? (ahh oooh)

I'm not over my my my love
I'm not over my my my love
I'm not over my my my love (oh no no)
I'm not over my my my love

Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)
Am I over her? (I'm not over my love my love, she's my love, she's my)
Tell me am I really over my my love (she's my everything)
I can't think straight (she's my everything, my everything)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

Not over not over my love
Not over not over my love
I'm not over not over my love
Am I over her?
Not over not over my love..


Backstreet Boys â" Tell me

(Yeah)
You can tell me what you want 

Girl you struck me like the sun 
So just tell me how you wanna be done 
I know you a couple of weeks 
You seem like you don't play stupid tricks

Sweety you are so beautiful 
I can imagine you must feel wonderful 
I like to know what I need to do 
How to behave, oh how to please you 
I can't take it, oh come home 
Let me feel those hips 
You can tell me what you wanna do 
If you want me to bring the freak outta you 

So let me put my ego on the side (whatever you wish) 
I ain't got no pride 
Girl I became your biggest fan 
I could be your perfect man 

Chorus
You can tell me what you want 
you can tell me what you need 
I will do whatever you want 
Just don't make my heart bleed 
Girl don't you understand 
that your wish is my command 
So baby drop the match 
Show me what's the task 
And tell me everything you want 

Girl you told me what was in the past 
All the relationships that never last 
No man ever let you be free 
And oh you're fed up with the jealousy 

I'll give you all the freedom that you need 
Baby you and I will succeed 
I like to know what I need to do 
How to behave, oh how to please you 
I can't take it, oh come home 
Let me kiss those lips 
You can tell me what you wanna do 
If you want me to bring the freak outta you 

Don't want violated things and make you mad 
Don't want violated things that make you sad 
Let me just find it right here pretty lady
We can make it baby

Chorus (2x)

What if we loose all the money baby 
What if there's nothing but you and me 
Tell me what would you do pretty lady 
Would you at least take care of me 

You can tell me how you deal the stress 
When everything becomes a big mess 
We stay strong and fight it off 
Or would you pack your shhh, and take off..

Spend your life with me baby
Spend your life with me baby girl
Spend your life with me baby 
Spend your life with me baby girl 
(2x)

Chorus (2x)


LOVING YOU

I love how loving you makes me feel 
and I love how loving you feels so real 
through the good through the bad 
when I'm happy or sad 
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world 
Ohoooh Loving you than anything else 

All my life I've dreamed of a princess all dressed in white 
Standing there to be my bride and then there's you 
A sending from Heaven right before my eyes 
Letting me know that there is a God somewhere I know 
Many people think they find love in the world 
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you 

I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah 
and I love how loving you feels so real so real baby 
through the good through the bad 
when I'm happy or sad 
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world 
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world) 

All my life I've wondered if I'd hear all the bells and whistles 
If the one should come my way 
Then there is you like the wind makes the earth shake 
Making me a believer there must be a God somewhere I know 
Many people think they find love in the world 
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you 

This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch 
nor does it come from anything you can't pay for 
Its so pure if we just send love on in the world 

Cus I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah 
and I love how loving you feels so real so real so real 
through the good through the bad the bad 
when I'm happy or sad 
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world 
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world) 

I love how loving you makes me feel 
and I love how loving you feels so real 
through the good through the bad 
when I'm happy or sad 
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world 
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world 
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world 
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world


Yeahhh

Opposites attract, chemicals react
But when I look at you
Deserts need the rain, fires feed the flame
We can't deny what's true

I can't help the way I feel
Cause you got me yeah
All these elements are real
They come from deep within me

I would move heaven and earth for this fire
For this ocean, I'd fight for you
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can't do
I love you, I love you
This power is greater than the forces of nature

We don't have no walls
The beauty of it all (beauty of it all)
Is waiting in your eyes
Breathing on my skin
Just let me take it in
Under an open sky

I can't help the way I feel
Cause you got me yeah (oh you know I can't)


All these elements are real
They come from deep within me

I would move heaven and earth for this fire
For this ocean, I'd fight for you
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can't do
I love you (oh I love you) I love you
This power is greater than the forces of nature

Nothing is greater
Than the energy I get from loving you
Sooner or later
It'll take us too forever

I would move heaven and earth for this fire
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (ohhh)
Let this emotional wind take us higher
Where there's nothing we can't do (nothing we can't do)

I would move heaven and earth for this fire (for this fire)
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (I'd fight for you)
Let this emotional wind take us higher (let this emotional wind)
Where there's nothing we can't do (nothing we can't do)
I love you (I love you baby) I love you (I love you baby)
This power is greater than the forces of nature


Darkness falls 
I thought I heard you call 
Or was it just a dream? 
I'm a little scared knowing you're out there 
So far away from me 

Its been so long 
Since you've been gone 
Every day I miss you more 
Now I wanna know 
Why did you have to go? 
What were you looking for? 

And I hope you find your way, 
But I can't wait to say 

You're home now, not alone now 
These arms are here to hold you 
Don't need to be afraid 
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment 
To open up this door and I know that it's not much 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 

So you lost your way but that's yesterday 
And I don't care where you've been 
Cause every step you've taking since you left 
Has brought you back again 
And I hope you see it clear 
My love has always been right here 

You're home now, not alone now 
These arms are here to hold you 
Don't need to be afraid 
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment 
To open up this door and I know that it's not much 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 

I'm glad you found your way 
And I hope you are here to stay 
oooooooh 

You're home now, not alone now 
These arms are here to hold you 
Don't need to be afraid 
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment 
To open up this door and I know that it's not much 
Welcome to my heart
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart 
Welcome to my heart ...


Ooh that sounds good, why don't you turn that up
Baby

(Listen) Pay attention are you listening 
Hey you're my favorite girl
Excuse me for a moment, I'm in another world
On a mountain, by a fountain, flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with Cupid, the pictures very clear

Chorus:
Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove

Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment I'm at a loss for words
By election you're perfection
And as if these eyes would care 
Your heart is in the right place so don't you go and change

Baby over and over the passion starts again
And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live
'Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still

Chorus:
Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Cause I want to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove

Bridge:
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood
Oooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off
It's time for me and you

Chorus:
Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove
All I need is just me and you
Cause I want to say that I'm so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feelings so real
Don't disturb this grove

It's the feeling girl (repeat)

You wanna do things, do things, do things, good things with it
Talk about cash money, money
Talk about cash money- dollar bills, yall

For the love of money
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money
People will rob their own brother
For the love of money
People can't even walk the street
Because they never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For that lean, mean, mean green
Almighty dollar, money

For the love of money
People will lie, Lord, they will cheat
For the love of money
People don't care who they hurt or beat
For the love of money
A woman will sell her precious body
For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
Call it lean, mean, mean green

Almighty dollar

I know money is the root of all evil
Do funny things to some people
Give me a nickel, brother can you spare a dime
Money can drive some people out of their minds

Got to have it, I really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Some people really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Got to have it, I really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Lay down, lay down, a woman will lay down
For the love of money
All for the love of money
Don't let, don't let, don't let money rule you
For the love of money
Money can change people sometimes
Don't let, don't let, don't let money fool you
Money can fool people sometimes
People! Don't let money, dont let money change you,
it will keep on changing, changing up your mind.


Love Knows I Love You

You make me say it 25 times a day
You make me feel you don't believe the words I say
What is a man to do to prove his love for you?
You make me feel like i'm just givin' free love away

I can send flowers tomorrow
But it doesn't mean a thing
If your heart rejects the message from mine
It's a waste of time

Baby love knows I love you
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you

Yeah, I look at you and know I never loved anyone more
You make me feel like a child in a candy store
What can I do to prove
That you're a dream come true
And in this dream there's a pulse from my heart to you
I can send daisies daily
But it never will penetrate
If your heart if rejects the best from mine
It's a waste of time

Baby love knows I love you (I really do)
Baby love knows the truth
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you (I really do, babe)
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you 

Baby I'm lookin for cupid
Can I tie him in a ball and chain
To see if he can say to you
The words that make you feel my love is real, oh

Baby love knows I love you
(That's right you know I love you, baby girl)
Baby love knows the truth
(Hey gotta know the truth, you know I love you)
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here
Resting in my heart
(In my heart)
From the very start
I loved you
(Yeah, that's right)
Resting in my heart
From the very start
I loved you, yeah


Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up. Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up...

When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul 
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control 
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know 
You still care for me, say a prayer for me, and I know 

Oooh, I like you hangin' around 
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down 
Oooh, you are my favorite sound 
'Cause you're always down for 

Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground 
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down 
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low 
When your arms are around me 
I don't wanna let you go 

When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day 
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load 
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity 
Would you hold my hand? 
Say you understand my pain 

Oooh, I like you hangin' around 
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down 
Oooh, you are my favorite sound
'Cause you're always down for

Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground 
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down 
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low 
When your arms are around me 
I don't wanna let you go 

It's been a long hard road, and it's only just begun, my friend 
And this I know
You helped me carry the load 
'Cause you're always down for 

Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground 
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down 
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low 
Well, you're always around 
You're my favourite sound 

Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground 
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down 
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low 
When your arms are around me 
I don't wanna let you go 

I don't wanna let you go 
'Cause you lift me up now 
Well, you're always around.. 
You're my favourite sound 
Lift me up now 
You lift me up 
Lift me up now 
Yeah, you're always around 
You're my favourite sound 

Lift me up


I love you with everything that's in me 
Did you know that? 
You'll be the first that's ever been so close 
You should know that 
I've been loving you since the beginning 
For what it's worth I've always been waiting for this moment 

One special night for one special girl 
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth 
With everything I am I promise it will be 
Much sweeter than you ever could dream 
Let's do it tonight baby 
Let's do it for love 

Never had a reason to believe that love would find me 
It must've known something that I didn't know 
And you showed me that if I had a chance to go to heaven 
Girl I'd stay here cause nothing could make me miss this moment 

One special night for one special girl 
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth 
With everything I am I promise it will be 
Much sweeter than you ever could dream 
Let's do it tonight baby 
Let's do it for love 

I can't think of any place I'd rather be than here with you 
When I hold you close to me feeling every bound of your heartbeat, baby 
It's the way you look into my eyes 
That lets me know just what you wish it's for a night like this 

One special night for one special girl 
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth 
With everything I am I promise it will be 
Much sweeter than you ever could dream 
Let's do it tonight baby 
Let's do it for love 

Let's do it tonight baby 
Let's do it for love


Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts


The one you hate to love that's made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon.


Walking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time, it takes time (takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'd be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything, everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time (takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'd be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything, everything but mine

Everything thing but mine, ooh
Mine I know, oh baby

I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down
Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine
I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'd be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything, everything but mine

You're everything but mine, yeah
You're everything but mine, yeah, ooh
You're the sun
You're the star
You're the moon
You're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane
Oh baby, baby
Oh you're everything but mine, yeah
You're everything but mine

Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love
That's made for you

Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Sunday afternoon


I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
When I let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, ohh
If you were here right now, I swear, I'd tell you this

Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me
'Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So I cannot make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility, oh, whoa

Baby I don't want to waste another day (another day)
Keping it inside it's killing me 
'Cause all I ever want it comes right down to you (uh, to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Oh oh no no no
I don't want to be like this
I just want to let you know
'Cause everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oh oh oh oh, I can't let go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

'Cause baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me (killing me 'cause)
'Cause all I ever wanted (all I ever wanted) comes right down to you (to you), to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave 
I'm inconsolable, oh oh oh oh

Don't you know it baby, I don't want to waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh
I'm inconsolable
Whoa oh oh oh yeah yeah oh oh
I'm inconsolable
Oh oh yeah yeah


Here we are,
Seven days 
And seven nights of empty tries
It's rituals, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time

We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still 
And still we stay, in all this pain
And nothing's going to make it go away

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear

Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice 
Don't waste your breath 
Can't you see we're at the end?
This goodbye, it's permanent
So wish me well 
And try to forget

All the fights 
And all the ways 
We almost made it 
But we never did
And finally it's come to this

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear

Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know



She keeps the secrets in her eyes 
She wraps the truth inside her lies 
And just when I can't take what she's done to me 
She comes to me 
And leads me back to paradise 

She's so hard to hold 
But I can't let go 

I'm a house of cards in a hurricane 
A reckless ride in the pouring rain 
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel 
She dances away just like a child 
She drives me crazy, drives me wild 
But I'm helpless when she smiles (oh when she smiles.. she smiles..)

Maybe I'd fight it if I could (Maybe I'd fight it if I could)
It hurts so bad, but feels so good 
She opens up just like a rose to me 
When she's close to me 
Anything she asked me to, I would 

It's out of control 
But I can't let go 

I'm a house of cards in a hurricane 
A reckless ride in the pouring rain 
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel 
She dances away just like a child 
She drives me crazy, drives me wild 
But I'm helpless when she smiles (oh no.. when she smiles..)

When she looks at me (When she looks at me) 
I get so weak

Oh I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a 
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane 

A reckless ride in the pouring rain 
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel 
She dances away just like a child 
She drives me crazy, drives me wild 
But I'm helpless when she smiles (oh when she smiles... when she smiles.. she smiles.....)

Any way the wind blows



There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you.
I tell my heart but
I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you.

Now you're carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That its time to accept its the way things are
I wish I could but...

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel
It's like I'm living in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real..

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears, they never hit the ground
Like your still here, your still here

Since you drained all the color out of the sky

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.




Ooh, oh, oh 
She wakes up with the sun
(The sun)
She throws on her clothes
(Her clothes)
Hoping her car will start 
The second time around 
The day has begun
(Begun)
The lines out the door
(The door)
Serving up fraps 
Until she can't take anymore

I see it in her broken smile
Oh, I wish I could tell her 

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

No, she never looks my way 
She never, never, ever looks my way 
She ties up her hair
(Her hair)
Her makeup is smeared 
(Is smeared)
Wiping the tears that she wants no one to see
She screams on the pain 
I hear every word
Why don't you know? 
How beautiful you are 

Just see it in my broken smile
Oh, I wish I could tell her

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

If I could be the light
To guide you through 
The darkness baby
If I could be the one 
To change the ending to your story 

I'd be one in a million, yeah
I'd be one in a million 
Someday I will tell her
You're gonna work it out someday

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way

You're one in a million
You're going the distance, babe
You're gonna work it out someday
I wish I could tell her
You're one in a million
But you never even look my way




Stop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it
Go, stop and go
I just hit static
I used to read you
Loud and clear
Not like this
It's so erratic

And I'm not rational
When I see you around
Your inconsistency
And you know it's dragging me down
You're so conflicted baby

You're always walking away (walking away)
One step and every thing's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

Stop it
I've made mistakes
I've been an addict
A blind fanatic
Don't you know
You're not immune to the panic
With somebody

When the snow hits your skin
The cold don't last forever
But you're livin' again
If you don't let seasons change

You're always walking away (walking away)
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry

How many times do I have to say it
Before you believe me

Stop it, stop it
Stop and go

Panic!
You're always walking away (walking away)
(You're always walking away)
One step and everything's over
And you're running back to me
You say I let you down
Baby take me in or just take me out
I'm already dead
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry




I could see in your eyes
Broken windows, falling skies
Baby, baby, what you hiding from
Like they followed you around (?)
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run

You've been holding on so long
Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

That you can let go

Sifting through the shattered dreams
Living in the in between
Baby, baby it's going to be all right
All right
(You can let go)
And when you're lost, let down,
disappointed, jerked around
In this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side

That you can let go
Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes
There's a crack in the dark

You never let me see you cryin'
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby, let me hold you tight

Make it all right

Baby, baby, it's gonna be all right
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah Yeah
I won't turn against you
Baby, baby, it's gonna be all right
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah Yeah

You can let go

You've been holding on so long
Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know


Trouble Is
How come you never know what you've got
Until it's gone
Too bad, cause I never felt so good with anyone
How fool was I into thinking I was gonna be alright..okay..fine

So every day I try a little harder to forget her
I'm here to convince myself tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save menow she's gone.(yeah)
The trouble is there's  a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it islove is what the trouble is
(Ohh it's what the trouble is..)

How come she said you'll never wear your heart
When I can see
Too bad, cause now I'm the one who's sorry
How stupid was I into thinking I was gonna be alright..okay..fine

So every day I find a little something to remind me
No matter how I try, I can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Whos gonna save me,now shes gone(yeah)
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
Now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is 

I'm alright, I'm okay, I'll be fine, give it time
But the only..

Trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes every night(ohh no no)
Whos gonna save me,now shes gone(now she's gone)
The trouble is there's still a part of me that still can't let go of her memory(I just can't)
And now I know what it is(yes I know) now I know what it is cause love is what the trouble is
(the trouble is)
Love is what the trouble is.( heyy heyy)


The first night that we met
I will never forget
Baby, you were a star
From that point in time
It was always you and I shining
So beautiful
Later out with your friends
You treat me like I'm dead
It was like I'm invisible

(I can't let it go)
That was unforgettable
(I can't let it go)
I just wanna let you know
(I can't let it go)
Situation's unlivable
(I can't let it go)
I can't let it go
(I can't let it go)

Tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

Oh, you got me twisted
Oh, you got me twisted
I'm not someone you can just disrespect
How would you feel if you were in my shoes
Feelin' used with your heart bruised

(I can't let it go)
The situation's critical
(I can't let it go)
Relationship is pitiful
(I can't let it go)
Everything's falling apart
(I can't let it go)
Cause you're so hypocritical

Tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

You're just no good for me
You're no good for me
You're just no good for me
I know you're no good for me

You know
It's wrong to treat me cold
I have no one to hold
One day I'm gonna say goodbye
What's it gonna be
Cause girl I'm gonna leave
Unless you turn around
And treat me right

So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right

Just treat me right
Just treat me right

Say that you want me
Just treat me right
Just treat me right

So tell me why you say that you want me
When all you ever do girl is push all my buttons
You always bring me down in public
When nobody's around you say that you love me
Make me say oh no
I see you all alone
I'm halfway out the door
Unless you turn around
And you treat me right


I won't tell nobody
I'll just scream it in my mind
Nothing good in life is scripted
It's not like we predicted
That the one you want 
Is gonna be the one you thought

I won't tell nobody
But I won't live like a prisoner
Nothing has to be so perfect 
Can you tell me was it worth it
Because the heart can't lie
And even though the face may try
Love can keep you up all night

Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine

Took you to the other side
Love will keep you up all night

If I don't tell a living soul
Still everyone would know (yes they would)
It's always 3 am somewhere
You know it when you get there
See people try to cover it up
Some people think it's never enough

Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine

I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
But one day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried 
Stayin' up all night

Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine

Cause love will keep you up all night
It's not something you can decide
One day you're all alone
And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine



Anytime, anywhere, any place
You could be anyone today
Maybe I will recognize you on a crowded street

Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind?

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure 
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be Unmistakable? 

People say to watch our life 
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance 
I know you're out there
Holding on 
Holding out for me

Are we gonna know the time is right 
What if you're here and I'm just blind

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure 
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be Unmistakable? 

How can I know a song I've never heard?
How will I know your voice when you haven't said a word? 
How do I know how this will end 
before we begin? 
(before we begin?)

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure 
That you're the one I'm waiting for?
Will you be?

Will you be Unmistakable?

Unmistakeable...



How come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting sunday afternoon 
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
And the people walkin' by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow (oh yeah)
How decidedly my life has changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go.

And I miss your face

Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

No, Oh Baby
This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes (Like the afternoon)
And now I'm running blind (running blind)
And I can't explain (can't explain)
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon 




Oh yeah yeah
I've been walking around
Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost
Of yesterday
Feels like I'm barely breathing

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Na na na na (repeats a few more times)
Feel the rain

I've been losin days
Shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I, I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
Feel the rain

Oh no
I thought you were the only
One, but now I think I was
Wrong 'cause life goes on
Na na na na na (repeats a few more times)

I've been walking around inside a haze

Oh I

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour (I wanna feel the rain)
I wanna Feel the rain

I, I wanna feel the rain again
I, I wanna feel the water
On my skin
And let it all just wash away
In a downpour
I wanna feel the rain
In a downpour, I wanna
Feel the rain
Na na na na...

In a downpour feel the rain
Feel the rain, oh oh

I wanna feel the rain




So I lay awake another hour
Just like the one before 
The shadows play a game with my head
I can't take this anymore 
I hear the sound 
Of my own breathing
It makes me miss you more

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me 
As I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

I can't take the chance
Of running into
You running into me 
So lock the door
And close the window
I just wanna see 
Until the day
Inside my future
When I'll be on my feet

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
When the damage has all been done
I don't wanna be somewhere
Where you can watch me 
As I bleed
Just leave me here in pieces
In pieces

If you want you can find me
On the dark side of the sun
Babe I dont wanna see what we've become
The damage has all been done

Wake me up when it's over
After the ending
Wake me up when it's over 
When the damage has all been done
The damage is done 
I don't wanna be somewhere
I don't wanna be somewhere 
Where you can watch me as I bleed
Somewhere where you can ?help me bleed baby? 
Leave me here in pieces

Just leave me in pieces
Just leave me in pieces
Just wake me up when it's over
Just wake me up when it's over



Lookin' for beauty and uncertain
Finding the strength inside the gray
Maybe I'm headin' for a breakdown
Or maybe that's OK

Could be I'm hangin' on for dear life
Maybe I need to get a grip
'Cause you're the only one makes me feel like this so

Save me I'm fallin' again
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces
In the end no matter what I do
There's nowhere, nowhere to go,
Nowhere to go but you

Try to bring nothing out of something
Promised myself I wouldn't care
Baby you're makin' me a liar
Because I'm standin' here

Find a crack in my resistance
Find a way to wear me down
Yeah, I just look at you and there's no way out

Save me I'm fallin' again
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces
In the end no matter what I do
There's nowhere, nowhere to go,
Nowhere to go but you

Every single road I take... it's you
Asleep or wide awake... it's you
And it's too late
For maybe one to save me

I'm fallin' again
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces
In the end no matter what I do
There's nowhere, nowhere to go,
Nowhere to go but you



Here I am again
Waiting on the moment you decide
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere
I've been so close to you so many times
I feel like I could drown
I wish that I could fly away from here

But I'm still coming down

From the last time

That you came around

In the starlight

Now I'm pulling to your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite

Like a lonely satellite

With walks on Jupiter
Fool around the moon a time or two
Left a mark on every star we could find
But now I'm burning like a meteor
That never hits the ground
Wish that I could fly away from you

But I'm still coming down

From the last time

That you came around

In the starlight

Now I'm pulling to your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite

Love is poisoning the atmosphere
Is keeping everything unclear to me

Something in your eyes
Never satisfies
I'm feeling so alone, tonight

But I'm still coming down (still coming down)
From the last time (the last time)
That you came around (you came around)
In the starlight (the starlight)
Now I'm pulling to your gravity (ooooh)
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night (falling through the night)
Yes I'm falling through the night (falling through the night)
Like a lonely satellite

Like a lonely satellite


In the heart
Of the night
Where it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Ohhhh Ohhhhh

I looked down
And my shirts turning red
I’m spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you
want you tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can’t stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can’t believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down(my heart)
Soldier down(my heart)

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Ohhhh ohhhh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can’t, I just can’t
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can’t stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can’t believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down(my heart)
Soldier down(my heart)

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Ohhhh Ohhhhh

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can’t stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can’t believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down(my heart)
Soldier down(my heart)

Straight through my heart
Soldier down(my heart)
Soldïer down(my heart)


First off I cant keep a promise 
I'm no one to count on at all 
Add on that I'm a coward 
To scared to return your calls 

But you don't care 
You keep sticking around 
While I'm acting a clown 
You're bigger 
Lalala 
Cuz you're still here 
Your feet stuck to the ground 
Despite how silly it sounds 
You're bigger 
Than me 
Lalala

Often I'm blacker than white 
Add on my uncanny ego 
No ones less humbled than I

You keep sticking around 
While I'm acting a clown 
You're bigger 
Lalala 
Cuz you're still here 
Your feet stuck to the ground

You're bigger 
Than me 
Lalala

Yeah I swear I'll make'em up to you 
Before you're going heaven knows 
Just let me make it better 
I'll try to measure up 
I'll try to measure up to you 

I'll make it up to you 

But you don't care 
You keep sticking around 
While I'm acting a clown 
You're bigger 
Lalala 
Cuz you're still here 
Your feet stuck to the ground 
Despite how silly it sounds 
You're bigger 
Than me 
Lalala

Life should be like a game of cards 
You make a mistake 
Then fold the deck and start over 
It should be just like drivin in your car 
Get lost and your navigation system 
Gets you closer 

But there ain't no handbook 
You're on your own 
Got no instructions 
When it comes to love 
Cuz once you do something 
Can't be undone 
Wish I could take back 
Letting you go 

If I knew then 
What I know now 
I wouldn't have said 
I don't need you around 
Alone in this mess 
Silence is so loud 
So I would treat you the best 
Baby if I knew then 
What I know now (What I know now) 
What I know now (What I know now) 
What I know now (What I know now) 
Yeah I would treat you the best 
Baby if I knew then 
What I know now 

Wish I get remote controls 
Then I just rewind into 
The time it was better 
It should have a restart button 
So, I could travel right back 
To the day that I met her 

But there ain't no handbook 
You're on your own 
Got no instructions 
When it comes to love 
Cuz once you do something 
Can't be undone 
Wish I could take back 
Letting you go 

If I knew then 
What I know now 
I wouldn't have said 
I don't need you around 
Alone in this mess 
Silence is so loud 
So I would treat you the best 
Baby if I knew then 
What I know now (What I know now) 
What I know now (What I know now)

Cuz there ain't no handbook 
You're on your own 
Got no instructions 
When it comes to love 
See once you do something 
Can't be undone 
Wish I could take back 
Letting you go 

If I knew then 
What I know now 
I wouldn't have said 
I don't need you around 
Alone in this mess 
Silence is so loud

Got a million reasons to run and hide 
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no) 
Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you 
Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware) 
I would change the stories ending to me and you 
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do 

I could be the one 
Give you all my love 
Forget what he has done to you 
I'm here now 
Open up to me 
Love will set you free 
If ever you believe it 
Please believe in me

I know everything isn't meant to last 
Box up all those photographs 
Your moving on (yeah) 
I could flip back over that hour glass 
And refill the better half (the better half) 

And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend 
Wont you dry up all those tear drops and start again 

I could be the one 
Give you all my love 
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now 
Open up to me 
Love will set you free 
If ever you believe it

Cause there's no need to rush when I know 
I could be the one 
Give you all my love 
Forget what he has done to you 
I'm here now 
Open up to me 
Love will set you free 
If ever you believe it 
Please believe in me

Intimacy's
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

I said,
Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)

Your P-D-A, hey hey
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)

From the lobby to the patio
(Boy you're so crazy)
And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navho
(Hmm, nasty)
And we're so compatible

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey

Public display of affection
Mmm I want your PDA



Backstreet 
Listen up 

This scene's so hypnotic 
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic 
Paper faces in gold 
There's solider boys, beauty queens 
Everyone's a mystery 
It's got me losing control 

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 

Just like a perfect dream 
I don't ever wanna leave 
A thousand freaks in the show 
One's a tiger, one's a lynx 
One's a king that suffering 
Moving high, moving low 
Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes? 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 

I gotta know the girl behind the mask 
Let me in, where you've been, don't pretend 
Dreamed that I had her alone 
Show your face to me, we could be everything 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay 

A masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All though the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade





OoohOooh 
Oooh ooh ohh yeah 
Ohh no 
Yeah.. 

Shorty ain't got cable, 
She don't even got a radio, way more than able. 
What kinda girl should I take her for? 
The perfect kind, just what I like, 
exactly what I had in my mind, a dream... 
She's a dream... yeah.. 

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night. 
And when I'm outta town to go and do work, 
I'm first class every flight. 
If she takes the time to open her eyes, 
she can realize that she's a dream... 
cause she knows me... 

Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity, 
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree. 
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP. 
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me... 
That's why I make her say... Ooh 
Make her say... Aaah 
Make her say... Uhhh 
Make her say... Aaahh 

Shorty don't know who I am... 

And I'm cool with that, if she says so 
I even got a lot to her 
And when I'm out making pesos? 
Aint' nobody treat her like I do her. 
Cause I'm the one that she thinks about, 
The only one on her mind, 
She's a dream... 
cause she knows me... 

Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage, 
like 3 or 4 times a week 
she don't even know I've been around the world 
and all the different girls and me. 
But there's just one, face that I see 
She's the only one for me 
She's a dream.. 
cause she knows me.... 
Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity, 
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree. 
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP. 
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me... 
That's why I make her say... Ooh 
Make her say... Aaah 
Make her say... Uhhh 
Make her say... Aaahh 

See, shorty don't know who I am 
That's not good for us, cause I know, 
it's not good to fuss 
And I know she loves me, for me 
and i love her, for her 
but It wouldn't work if she ever gave 
a damn 'bout who I am but she knows me 

she don't know I'm a celebrity, 
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree. 
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP. 
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me... 
Uuuuuh 
Make her say... Aaah 
Make her say... Uhhh 
Make her say... Aaahh 

About me...



<So empty, can't feel no more, 
As I'm left with my tears on the floor 
I wait for my heart to mend, 
But you keep tearing a hole 

Inside, I'm so lost, 
In the middle of my heart 
It's a battlefield of love, 
I've been fighting for too long 

And now I'm shattered, 
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke) 
Oh how it hurts 
(Felt) it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered) 
I'm so shattered 
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered) 
So shattered 
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh) 
So shattered 
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered) 
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh 

What am I still here for, 
Could it be that I'm just waiting 
Hoping you'd rescue me, 
And put the pieces together again 

Inside, I'm so lost, 
In the middle of my heart 
It's a battlefield of love, 
I've been fighting for too long 

And now I'm shattered 
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke) 
Oh how it hurts 
(Felt it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered) 
I'm so shattered 
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered) 
So shattered 
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh) 
So shattered 
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered) 
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh 

Tell me what you're really here for, 
If you never really loved me 
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough 

'Cause all you had to say was that you ain't 
Looking for committment 
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, oh-ho 

You took my emotions 
and scattered them on the ground 
So hard to just pick up, 
and move on with life, again 
And now I'm shattered (Oooh) 
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke) 
Oh how it hurts 
(Felt it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered) 
I'm so shattered 
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered) 
So shattered 
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh) 
So shattered 
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered) 
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh 
So shattered 

Can't believe, you and me, ahh



Your words burn, they're melting 
What we have, I'm breaking down 
No reason, no warning, no love loss 
You might as well 

Take our pictures off the walls tonight 
I don't wanna see you no more 
I don't wanna feel you no more 
Take our memories, throw them all aside 
I hope you finally get what you want 
Now you know 

I didn't wanna live without you 
I didn't wanna love without you 
I used to think I'd die without you 
Now it's killing me 
That we can be undone 

I can't feel without you 
You know I can't deal without you 
And now I got a life without you 
Now it's killing me 
That we can be undone 

This constant echoing 
In my head, 
I'm spinning round 
You seem so unaffected 
While I go on in this hell 

Take our pictures off the walls tonight 
I don't wanna see you no more 
I don't wanna feel you no more 
Take our memories, throw them all aside 
I hope you finally get what you want 
Now you know 

I didn't wanna live without you 
I didn't wanna love without you 
I used to think I'd die without you 
Now it's killing me 
That we can be undone 

I can't feel without you 
You know I can't deal without you 
And now I got a life without you 
And it's killing me 
That we can be undone 

We can be undone 

You're talking now 
and I'm hearin' everything that you say 
And I'm holding on is a real phrase 
And it's dragging me along to my grave 
it's dragging me to my grave 

You're talking now 
and I'm hearin' everything that you say 
And I'm holding on is a real phrase 
And it's dragging me along to my grave 
I didn't wanna live without you 
I didn't wanna love without you 
I used to think I'd die without you 
Now it's killing me 
That we can be undone 
I can't feel without you, You know I can't deal without you 
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me 
That we could be undone 

I didn't wanna live without you 
I didn't wanna love with you 
I used to think I'd die without you 
Now it's killing me 
That we can be undone 
I can't feel without you, You know I can't deal without you 
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me 
That we could be undone


I wake up every morning and see your face
Lying right beside me it fills the space
In my heart
I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
And every time I lay my head down to sleep
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat
So loud
I can't hear the sound
Do you hear it'
For you

I fall in love all over again
Each time
I lay my eyes on you
I pretend
I feel so helpless
Without you
Feel so helpless
Without you
It takes a piece of me
Each time you leave
I feel it in my chest
So hard to breathe
I feel so helpless
Without you
I feel so helpless
Without you

I witness every trick you got up your sleeve
But still somehow you keep on surprising me
I'm yours
I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
Every time I see you I feel like I
Could be the luckiest man in the world
Why try to fight it
There's no need to hide it
Because
You know

I fall in love all over again
Each time
I lay my eyes on you
I pretend
I feel so helpless
Without you
Feel so helpless
Without you
Helpless
It takes a piece of me
Each time you leave
I feel it in my chest
So hard to breathe
I feel so helpless
Without you
I feel so helpless

Without you

Feels like
I fall apart
Every time
Where do I start
I'm so helpless
Without you
Without you

Every time I close my eyes
You're the first thing that runs to my mind
Everywhere I go
I see you
Hear you
Feel you
I just wanna be near you
And heal' you
Last thing you said is how dare you
First thing I said is I'm sorry
Now I'm sitting here
Helpless
Man
Same old story

Now she's brokenhearted
Time heals all the wounds
She said
Not this time
It's true
Everyone plays a fool
And that fool is me
Because I foolishly
Took advantage of a woman who loved me

I fall in love all over again
Each time
I lay my eyes on you
I pretend
I feel so helpless
Without you
Feel so helpless
Without you
It takes a piece of me
Each time you leave
I feel it in my chest
So hard to breathe
I feel so helpless
Without you
I feel so helpless
Without you

Ohh yeah

Pieces would come together

And I promise you baby

That I've tried but I can't try no more
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
And I've tried but I can't try no more

On without you, on without you
No I can't
It's impossible going...
On without you, on without you
No I can't

I hear you walking through the halls
And I know you're not home
The thought of you is all that remains
I wonder if I call would you pick up the phone

And tell me that you're feeling the same
There's nothing left (in me), my (?) (empty)
The pieces will come together
I tell myself (why me) and if I'm wrong (why me)
I'm not giving up baby

But I've tried but I can't try no more (no more baby)
And I've cried but I can't cry no more
And I've tried but I can't try no more

And I've cried but I can't cry no more (tried It baby)
And I've tried but I can't try no more

You've got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm yours
You found me heartbroken, heartbroken
On the floor
Became my salvation, salvation
Through the war, yeah
You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm sure

In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we gotta take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you

And now I'm free falling, free falling
In your eyes
You got me still calling, still calling
No surprise

End of time, yeah

In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this, I've got you



Out of the rain, looking for sunshine
I call your name, but you’re like a ghost
I let you disappear, should’ve never let you go
I want to say just for the record
That you still got my heart and my soul
You know we’re worlds apart
Yeah, I've got to let you know
You are the piece I can’t replace, oh
You left a mark that won’t erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Nevermind what people say ’cause they don’t understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it

Some try to break through the walls
…but they don’t compare to you
One chance, I swear I’ll never let you go
You are the piece I can’t replace, oh
You left a mark that won’t erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Nevermind what people say ’cause they don’t understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it

One should… with time
Never gonna fade, one can touch the flame and tame the fire
You are the piece I can’t replace, oh
You left a mark that won’t erase, no

No one else can teach me how to love again
‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Nevermind what people say ’cause they don’t understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it



We're not over

Roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried

And I never knew alone, wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine 
And, no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me, 
No, I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe

Ooh, I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said hey, we're locking the door, no time to play

And I never knew alone, wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine 
And, no, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me, 
No, I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe

We're not over
We're not over

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine
and no, I can't...
You know I can't Breathe

Without your lips on mine, no, the sun doesn't shine 
And no, I can't breathe,I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe
(We're not, We're not over)
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe
(don't say it's over, don't say it's over)
Nooooo



Madeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down,
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine

Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you’d put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Hold on, don’t let go
Hold on and you’ll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine
Oh Madeleine



I’ve seen it all a thousand times
Falling down, I'm still alive, Am I? Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water’s high
Don’t need to swim, I learned to fly, so high, so high
You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of

The gloves are off, Ready to fight
Like a lion I will survive. Will I? Will I?
You gotta stand for something
Even if you stand alone, don’t be afraid
It's gonna be alright
You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of 
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
Just show ‘em what you’re made of

You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

When walls start to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sun light is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
Oh, oh, oh...
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
Just show ‘em what you’re made of


We can only make believe 
We can only make believe

Something that you said got into my head 
Here I am falling from the edge 
Waiting for the day I can run away with you, with you 

Like angels on fire we burn the sky 
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe 
You and me together 
We can be king and queen 
Rule another world forever 
We'd set our course to live or die 
Across the universe I'll be by your side 
If we could only believe

We can only make believe 
We can only make believe

Catch another breath, I got nothing left 
This love I have is pulling me to death 
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you...

Like angels on fire we burn the sky 
One kiss and we say goodbye

If we could only make believe 
You and me together 
We can be king and queen 
Rule another world forever 
We'd set our course to live or die 
Across the universe I'll be by your side 
If we could only believe

If we close our eyes 
Let our hearts collide 
Leave the world outside 
Leave it all behind 
If we close our eyes 
Let our hearts collide 
Leave the world outside 
Leave it all behind 

Leave the world outside 
Leave it all behind

If we could only make believe 
You and me together 
We can be king and queen 
Rule another world forever 
We'd set our course to live or die 
Across the universe I'll be by your side 
If we could only believe (x2)

If we close our eyes 
(If we could only make believe) 
Let our hearts collide 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave the world outside 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave it all behind 
(If we could only make believe) 
If we close our eyes 
(If we could only make believe) 
Let our hearts collide 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave the world outside 
(If we could only make believe) 
Leave it all behind 
(If we could only make believe)


Uh, uh I know that you're hurting now
Seems like there's just no way how
Feels like it's all gone wrong
You keep on sipping till you can't go on!

Don't worry, I'm not by your side
My shoulder is yours if you need to cry
Feel the times when life is just too much
I know you want to, but don't give up!

Try, baby try
Give me a moment of your time
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes

You know I've been down there, too!
Always when I needed you
You were strong!

When hope is gone!

I know you're hurt now
We can work it out
If we just try, if you just try!

Love
Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breath
Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall

You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
Cause nothing that I could dream
It's better the you by my side

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I, 
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody

When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face,
You know that I, and it's so cute,
You don't even know
How beautiful you are in me

You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
It's the reason why after every summer we fall
And the way that you look in those purple jeans
It's the sexiest thing I ever see

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I 
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I

When the games on
You wear the jersey of my favorite team
I yell at the TV...
You're not even mad of me
You know I love you baby

I love somebody, love somebody
I know, I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I, I'm so in love
I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I'm gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love girl 
Love somebody, love somebody




Hard to believe it
It's almost a year since
I got to hold you, head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I
It's all I got left, so lately I've spent

Every single night like its 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my

Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

First time it rings
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
That moment I knew
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

Every single night feels like 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, your always gonna be my

Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

So let me make my case
That way you won't erase the message
That I'm leaving for you now
But if you do at least you knew

Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call

I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

You'll always be my one
You'll always be my one
Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call
You'll always be my one phone call


Been down the back roads
Where the girls are homegrown
That southern dame’s so
Sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Drinking moonshine, bon fire, pour the gasoline

Farther south
Where the sweet tequila flows
Tiny clothes, Yo te amo, México
Señoritas, we are sippin’ margaritas on the beach
They got something you can’t teach

I’ve been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
Yeah, it all just feels like home
Yeah, it all still feels like home

Rock out in Bangkok, where the partys don’t stop
Eyes open, blood shot
Seeing things I’d never thought
Sweatin’ in the heat
God, I love the way they speak
Burning up the streets, dancing like a freak

I’ve been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
Yeah, it all just feels like home
Yeah,  it all still feels like home

So many things to see
So many eyes to meet
I couldn’t count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
You take a piece of me

Beijing, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, to tango
Moscow, Cape Town, showed us how to get down
London, Berlin, this is where it all began
San Juan, Sydney, can’t forget the NYC

I’ve been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
Yeah, it all just feels like home
Yeah, it all still feels like home


Wanna be there just in time,
Wanna be your shining knight,
Protect you like a soldier.

I wanna be the first in line,
Be the one to save your life
All I wanna do is hold you.

But somebody shot you down,
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little,
When you've heard those lies,
You need someone to make you believe,
Make you believe, oh, oh.

I will be your soldier,
I, I'll stay and fight it 'til it's over, oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if your heart is getting colder
You know I will always be your soldier

You don't have to hide your scars
I'll be there when you fall apart
And fix you like a soldier, oh
You don't have to go too far
Baby, just lay down your arms,
Now that battle is over.

Somebody shot you down,
Right in the middle of a war outside
Words mean so little,
When you've heard those lies,

Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on

It happened in the blink, blink, blink of the night
I guess it was the wrong, wrong side of goodbye
You caught me on the blind, blind, blind side
You didn't even stop once to think twice

Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wanted to turn around, turn around
Wish I'd have done it now

I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we both just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on

We didn't lose the beat, beat, beat in our hearts
After falling in so deep, so hard
So if you're running round, round, round in the dark
I'll find a way to reignite the spark

Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wanted to turn around, turn around
Wish I'd have done it now

I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we both just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on

So if you ever feel the need
Jump in your car and just drive back to me
Wherever you are, I will always leave the light on
So if you ever feel the need
Jump in your car and just drive back to me
Wherever you are, I will always leave the light on

Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
I need you baby
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
Leave a light, leave a light on
I leave a light on

I still remember how we left it that night
Said it was better if we both just moved along
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on, I leave a light on
Leave a light on


Out in the darkest place
With this a thousand shades of blue
Everyone looks the same
And then your light came into view

You stop my heart and got me sayin'
Where did you come from?
It's like you fell above of the sky to save me
An angel from the sun

I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we can fly together
To the stars, back to Mars
Everywhere you go
My future it's with you from tonight
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms

And when I touch your face
It's shows me worlds I never known
Frozen in time and space
Don't want to let this moment go

You stop my heart and got me sayin'
Where did you come from?
It's like you fell above of the sky to save me
An angel from the sun

I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we can fly together
To the stars, back to Mars
Everywhere you go
My future it's with you from tonight
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms

Stay with me, come stay with me forever, and ever
Takin' me, you're taking me to heaven, to heaven

I could live forever, in your arms, in your arms
Baby, we could fly together, to the stars, back to Mars

I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms
Baby, we can fly together
To the stars, back to Mars
Everywhere you go
My future it's with you from tonight
I could live forever
In your arms, in your arms



Ooh la da da da da da da (repeat)

To be happy
You are all I need
To make me happy
'Cause every time you're near
All the tears inside are raindrops
All the sadness in my lifetime
Goes away
Just believe in me
All I need is someone
Who believes in me
You're the good luck charm
You're the reason for the rainbows
God knows I'd hate to see you
Go away
Baby don't leave me this way

If you stay
If you stay I'll give you what you want
I'll show you
I'll show you I'm the only one for you
I'f you stay
I'f you stay with me I'll show you
How much I need you

To be with you
I just wanna constantly be with you
It's only when you're around
All the problems solve my problems
All the clouds inside my garden roll away
Baby they'd roll

If you stay
If you stay I'll give you what you want
I'll show you
I'll show you I'm the only one for you
I'f you stay
I'f you stay with me I'll show you
How much I need you

Oh and forever
You have all my graditude forever
Being who you are
Brings me victory as a promise
My frustrations and my losses fly high away
They'd fly high

If you stay
If you stay I'll give you what you want
I'll show you
I'll show you I'm the only one for you
I'f you stay
I'f you stay with me I'll show you
How much I need you

Only if you stay
Only if you stay


There's a spark of magic in your eyes
and Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairytales came true
but they come true, when I'm near you
Your a genie in disguise
full of wonder and surprise

And, Betcha by golly Wow!
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong, keep growing strong

Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words
to express all he feels inside
But ever just so often
the words of another, who's truly in love
Seem to work our just fine

To say I love you
To say.....
I love you

Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong


Tonight I saw a glimpse of your
Smile within my own
Reflection oh you looked
So beautiful there

A tear ran down my face
And all my memories erased
Oh why did you have to leave my side

Oh why do all the rivers flow into the ocean
And why does all the love in the world come straight from the heart
And why does all the pain I feel come from deep inside
Oh all these questions I could have answered
If you were by my side

Something made me look at you
Something made me do what I had to do, girl
Something made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should 
I want you by my side
(I want you by my side)
I want you by my side

Now every day the pain I feel
Slowly fades away
And all the memories of you and me
Are always here to stay
Oh what I'm asking girl
Is one more chance
To let me in your life
Oh girl if you give me one more chance
Then I could be right by your side

Something made me look at you
Something made me do what I had to do, girl
Something made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should
I want you by my side
I want you by my side
I want you by my side


It's another night, another day
It's another street, with another name
Just another storm, Just another rain
But now nothing feels the same

Yesterday I thought, this was solid ground
Just another thing, I was wrong about
But I never learn, Til it crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Guess what now, I can live without
All the foolish love, People talk about
Better by myself, with no one around
But that's what I'm saying now

But that's such a lie, cause I know that once
I look in her eyes, Fall back in love
Guess I'll never learn, Til it crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone

Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Said I was Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Call me crazy but I've been here before
And I promised myself I wouldn't fall
But looking now I'm so lost
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way because
I have a problem with one thing I shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous
But i can't keep on

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home, Don't try this at home
Don't try this at home

Playing with fire, Playing with fire

I don't think I want this anymore
As she drops the ring to the floor
She says to herself you've left before
This time you will stay gone that's for sure

And he shattered something else
To drag her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car

She said no, happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

As she drove away she starts to smile
Realized she hadn't for awhile
No destination she drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed in such denial

She was laughing about the way he shattered something else as
He dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car
She said no, happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

I'm done, I'm done, said I'm so done (so done)
I'm free, I'm free, (so free)
Free to feel the way I feel, yeah

She inhales a breath she never breathed before
Don't want no drama no more

Cause she says no happily never after
That just ain't for me
I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall (I'm done, I'm done)
No happily never after, that just aint for me, (I'm free, I'm free)because finally
I know I deserve better after all
I'll never let another tear drop fall, (I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, so done, I'm done, so done, said I'm done, I'm done, I'm done)

She (she, she) she like to model for me (me, me)
The way she wear it is dangerous 
She walk around me like a predator 
And I'm something to eat (eat, eat)

Nothing to her but a treat (treat, treat)
Something she play with and leave alone 
And I can't help it but to let her use me 

Every little thing about her says she's trouble (trouble) 
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more 
More and more 

She melts, melts herself all over me (me, me)
As sexy candle but so much hotter 
Pain is just pleasure with the volume up 
I want it louder 

I'm spending all my money on her 
No matter where I go there she is 
Half-naked waiting for me (waiting for me) 
Waiting for me (waiting for me, oh) 

Every little thing about her says she's trouble (trouble) 
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more 
More and more 

More and more 
More and more 
More and more

Every little thing about her says she's trouble (trouble) 
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more 

Oh, every little thing about her says she's trouble (trouble) 
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more 
More and more 

More and more 
More and more 
More and more

(Spoken:)
Girl you know
We belong together
I have no time for
You to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever
Baby, you just see

We belong together
And you that I'm right
Why do you play
With my heart,
Why do you play
With my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me
And leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try
I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh
I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

CHORUS:
Although we've come to
The end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the
End of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl, I know you
Really love me,
You just don't realise
You've never
Been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be
Happy together
Forever, you and I

Can you love me again
Like you loved me before
This time I want you
To love me much more
This time instead
Just come to my bed
And baby just
Don't let me
Don't let me down

Repeat chorus

(Spoken:)
Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night
When you just hurt me
And just run out
With that other fella
Baby I knew about it
I just didn't care
You just don't understand
How much I love you do you?
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out and
Cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby
But that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna
Be here for you
Till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in
So much pain baby
'Cause you just won't
Come back to me
Will you?

I know he's driving...a fancy car
When you're with him you're feeling like a star
But when I'm at home alone...I think only of you
So, what do you know? How does it grow?
So, how can he buy a love that's...not for sale?
If you two were so in love I couldn't tell...baby
Cuz when I'm at home alone I hear your heart, it spells
You gotta know... and how does it grow?

CHORUS
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Girl, I know that you are torn between what was and what could be
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know...
Who do you love?
Do you love?
Oh, yeah

So let's take some time out...to find a way
'Cause there's just so......many things I need to say
(So...many things that I need to say)
Cuz when the lights are down and love is in the air
And I need to know...do you really care?
(Do you really care, baby?)

CHORUS - repeat

BRIDGE
Girl, I've found I just can't leave you alone
(And nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong)
And I promise I will make of our own
And if you're ever in need
Put your full trust in me
And I will never leave you at home...

CHORUS

Who do you love?


Yeah yeah yeah yeah 

There are people who say what you wanna hear
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone am I right
When I say that you want them near
And if you care you even tell them things 
That they wanna hear

(Neptunes)
Let's party
Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room
Play time now holla
Pusha be the one you follow
Slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the go to Impala
Crushin, love my women in couples
Wanna each arm, keep double the trouble
So I gotta, shiffle my shuffle
Love how I cruised my hustle
Sex play, next day, call me

(AJ)
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in mysery
When I was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
And I, I got a little place nearby
I wanna go, I should have said no
Someone's waiting for me
But I'm gonna go up and see

(BSB)
Listen baby I'm sorry, just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby, gotta go

(Girl)
{Hello?}

(Nick)
Now till it's gone nothing's been won
I can't take it back what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

(BSB)
Listen baby I'm sorry, just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby, gotta go

(BSB)
{Listen baby I'm sorry}
(Girl)
{Hello?}
(x2)

(Neptunes)
Don't stay up and wait
Cause I'mma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can relate
I take it aways like two days stays
But look, still hear me on my two way page
See I'm happy in this treats like a cream debali
Call outside will take trips to Mauie
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie
Company by Clipse, Pusha T and Mally ??

(Nick)
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in mysery
When I was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
And I, I got a little place nearby

(AJ)
GOTTA GO

(BSB)
Listen baby I'm sorry, just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby, gotta go
(x2)
(BSB)
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
(x2)

(Girl)
{Hello?}
{Hello?}

(Neptunes)
Let's party
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
I gotta go girl




My feet on the ground but I can't run
Drowning the noise inside my head
Who is this man that I've become ?
It's killing me to see myself
How do you learn how to forgive
Deep down inside you can't forget
With all that I regret
I pray for the first time in a long time
The lies fade away

Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes
When I close my eyes

I'm alive

I never was sure but now I am
This was the choice I had to make
Maybe I'll never understand
Sometimes you gotta make mistakes

Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I face it off
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes

How do you know where to go when you walk away ?

When I close my eyes

How do you know that you know when it's over ?

I see for the first time in a long time
Believe me when I say,

Finally I'm waking up
I feel like I can let you go
Say everything I wanted to say
I'm okay with being alone
Finally I face it off
I feel like I can let it show
I know I can walk away
I'm okay with being alone
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)
When I close my eyes (close my eyes, close my eyes)

I'm alive

I'm alive



All, everything I have is for you

My name is Kev and I like the 
Type of girl who can love me for me
A type of girl who I can hold in my 
Arms and give her all that I have to give
And if you're that type of girl 
Then you're getting all of my love(my love, my love)
That's right baby

Hi, my name is Brian but you can call me B-Rok 
'Cause I'll be rockin' your house
Nah, I'm just playing, but on a real tip 
I like a serious girl
Somebody who's gonna be smart
A girl who even likes to even go to school

Yo Bri, stop lying

Now come on Nick, for real
I like a girl who's got a good head on her shoulder

Yeah right

Chorus:
My love, my love
All my love is for you
My love, my love

My love, my love
My love is all I have to give, baby

My name is Howie D and this is "howie" do it

We'll get married and she'll make me breakfast
She'll make me lunch and my dinner
I want bacon and egg, pancakes, orange juice, mash potatoes, turkey...

Yo, yo, Howie, Howie, chill out Howie, Howie
Yo my name's A.J, I like a type of girl 
Who'll let me do everything for her
Let me make you breakfast, let me make you lunch
Let me make you dinner baby

You see Howie, that's how you gotta do it
Howie, Howie, yo, yo, D.

My name is Nick and I like the type of girl that loves to go dancin'
The type of girl that likes to move her body
The type of girl that likes to shake what her mama gave her
The type of girl that lets me hold her hand and then kiss her
The type to let me take her to the movies and then kiss her
The type to let me hold her so tight and then kiss her
And kiss her, and kiss her, and kiss her..he he...

Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give


I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles

I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk
Does it seem like he's not even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love
I have inside, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
[Incomprehensible]
What I need, my love
All that I have to give to you

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

Ohh, all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you


Understand girl that my heart is in your hands
And I'm cautious of fallin' in love again
Please don't hurt me...
I'm scared
Don't desert me
I'm afraid of being a fool again

Baby I'm yours if you want me
(If you want my love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Lovin' you forever if you want me
(Give me your love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me

Realize girl that my faith is kind of torn
So watch your step girl
Because my heart is weak and worn
So won't you please be careful I'm fragile
I can't imagine the damage
I'll have to handle
If you hurt me one more time
Please be mine

Baby I'm yours if you want me
(If you want my love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Lovin' you forever if you want me
(Give me your love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me

Hey baby I finally found someone
That I can depend on
I just want you to know
That I'm your sweetheart...
Hey someone that you can depend on...
Don't you ever go nowhere, baby

Baby I'm yours if you want me
(If you want my love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me
Lovin' you forever if you want me
(Give me your love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me

Ohhh ohhh oooh ohhh...

You're in my mind
All the time
My thoughts
Are always of you
There are so many things
That we promised each other
That we would do

But since you went away
My heart has been in so much pain
It seems that everything we've been through
Has been in vain

And I can't stop thinkin' of you
And I wouldn't if I could
But I can't keep waking up
With dreams of you

And you should have known
When you told me you loved me
That you were deceiving
I have faith that the hurt that I feel
Deep inside will soon be leaving

But now I'm all alone
And I can't stop thinkin' of you
To hold you in my arms once again
Is all I wanna do

And I can't stop thinkin' of you
And I wouldn't if I could
But I can't keep waking up
With dreams of you


I saw you pull to the back
And roll with the cream in the back
I look at you, you look right back
Like you wanna get funky

I hit the bar, buy you a drink
Feel you out to see how you think

There is something special
About this time of year
The Christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home
To join You
I've been away too long
But now I'm back to share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love to last
Throughout the year

[Chorus]
Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and joy
The tidings to the world
Christmas time
The best time of the year
Yes, it's Christmas time

You and me together
A sleigh ride in the park
A loving kiss straight from my heart
Straight from the heart
Snowflakes are falling gently
The smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights they gleam
Across the sky

[Chorus]

Do you remember?
Everything felt so right
When I held you close to me
Do you remember?
Those cold Christmas nights
When we sewed the world in harmony

Christmas time
Time to share our love
Come and joy
The tidings to the world
Christmas time
Always the best time


I've been on the run
Slept under the sun
Feeding off the clouds and eating Them like ice cream
I've been all around
Never left this town
Blisters on my eyelids like it's Spring in paris
I've seen everything, I've dreamt Every dream
I am every human
Oh I'm not even finished

Look how I go
Impeccable flow
Wind in my face it hardly ever Rains
Always on top
I'm coming up
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all don't know a thing
I am changing, still the same
I'm every color I'm every color
I am evergreen

I've been on the side
Always stayed ahead
I'm so very fast give me a Speeding ticket
Me you cannot teach
I just wanna know
I've been tryin to stand but I Will never grow
I've seen everything, I've dreamt Every dream
I am every human
No I'm not even finished

Look how I go
Impeccable flow
Wind in my face it hardly ever Rains
Always on top

I'm coming up
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all don't know a thing
I am changing, still the same
I'm every color I'm every color
I am evergreen

The truth is stranger than fiction
When you're a walking contradiction
When you're evergreen
You're always looking in
You're the first one left
But you're back again
Don't be afraid to ask
But don't ask again
We'll forever last when you're Evergreen

Look how I go
Impeccable flow
Wind in my face it hardly ever Rains
Always on top
I'm coming up
I'm everything and I am everything
I know it all don't know a thing
I am changing, still the same
I'm every color,I'm every color
I'm every color
I'm every color(color)
I am evergreen
Yea I am evergreen
I am evergreen
I am evergreen


[I wanna know (4x)]
Yeah, I wanna know [I wanna know (4x)]
I wanna know

You had me fooled
You were so good at that
I'm so unglued
Too many pieces to put back
You were the best by far
How did we end up like this
I even know who you are
I can't believe it's like this
I wanna know

Chorus:
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared for me
So how does it feel
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Of love

I wanna know [8x]

I followed you
To the deepest part of love [of love]
And how do you
Destroy the life you built for us
This is a mystery
You played the part so well, yeah
Now this is history
Was I the last to tell
I wanna know

Chorus:
How does it feel to be a fallen angel

Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared for me
So how does it feel
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Of love

The only thing that's worse than emptiness
Is when your heart's lost
And the only thing that's worth the pain
Is the price of what love costs
Cause when you think it's all in your hands
That's when it's gone
And you're thinkin' you're invincible
Believe me you're so wrong
Tell me how does it feel

Chorus:
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Your wings are lying on the ground
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Forever is a long way down
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be
But everything has disappeared for me
So how does it feel
How does it feel to be a fallen angel
Of love

I wanna know [4x]
Tell me how does it feel [2x]
I wanna know [4x]
I wanna know how it feels
I wanna know [4x]

I see people come and go, see people fall in & outta love
As my mother told me she said don't let life control me, but I did
So what you think of me, what you think of me now and who I am? 
I'm everything you wanted me to be, as you can see I'm very happy

I need sometime to find myself in me


And I need sometime to find true love
But if I can't then I won't stop trying
If I don't then I won't live lying
What do people really want? 
They wanna be happy...
I wanna be happy.

Guardo dentro me e so già
Cosa resterà di noi
Quello che vorrei sei tu
Ma niente ti riporta qui.
Che cosa non farei per te
Ma il tempo gioca contro me
Quanto ti vorrei non sai oh no.
Non puoi lasciarmi così, lo sai o no
(non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai)
Non puoi giocare così con me
(non puoi giocare mai non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai)
Non farlo mai.
Ritornerai lo so
Mi vedo già vicino a te
Dammi un segno che tu ci sei
Io voglio immaginarti qui.
Che cosa non farei per te
Ma il tempo gioca contro me
Quanto ti vorrei non sai oh no.
... lo sai che.
Non puoi lasciarmi così, lo sai o no
(non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai)
Non puoi giocare così con me
(non puoi giocare mai non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai)
Non farlo mai.
Se ci credi see'è ancora un domani per noi
Possiamo ancora stare insieme.
Se ci tieni
Starò qui con te
Sarai qui con me.
Ritornerai lo so
Mi vedo già vicino a te
Dammi un segno che tu ci sei
Io voglio immaginarti qui.
Che cosa non farei per te
Ma il tempo gioca contro me
Quanto ti vorrei non sai oh no.
Non puoi lasciarmi così, lo sai o no
(non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai non mi lasciare mai)
Non puoi giocare così con me
(non puoi giocare mai non mi lasciare mai)
Non puoi giocare così non puoi lo sai non puoi.


Intimacy's
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

I said,
Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A, hey hey
(I want your P-D-A)
Your P-D-A hey hey

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in that direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your P-D-A hey hey

And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navho
(Hmm, nasty)
And we're so compatible

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly

Public display of affection
Mmm I want your PDA


Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things, I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So help me, I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man, I've become

Looking back on the things, I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm looking back on things, I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
Keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Looking back on the things, I've done

I?m so sorry
That I called you
I?m trying to pick up
The pieces of my life
I forgot that we were over
Tell me what went wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

Twelve days, four hours, twenty minutes
I?m stuck and you know you?ve got me in it
Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame
Shame, shame, shame

We had it all
This love so strong
Now everything
We had is gone
If you could read my mind
You?d know I?ve crossed that line

Cos I?m as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it?s killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There?s nowhere to run
Girl I can?t let you go
And it?s twisted I know
But I just can?t take it no more

Six miles, twelve lights till your front door
I?m on my way just like I have so many times before
Does he know that it?s me you?ve been talking to?
Shame, shame, shame

If you could read my mind
I?m gonna fight to get you back this time

Cos I?m as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it?s killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There?s nowhere to run

Girl I can?t let you go
And it?s twisted I know
But I just can?t take it no more

I?m tired of all these lies
There?s nothing but regret behind these eyes
All this love I could never show
I don?t care any more
Give a damn who knows

Cos I?m as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it?s killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you back with me
There?s nowhere to run
Girl I can?t let you go
And it?s twisting my soul

Tired of all the lies

Gonna shout it from a mountain top
Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we?ve cried
Gonna break down these walls
Gonna stand tall
Gonna be your man
Hope you understand, oh
That I?ll never let you go


Oh,
Some say that love isnt fair,
But they don't know you and me,
And when they tell me that love doesn't last that long,
Thats when I look at you,

And it's alright,
Just let me lead you,

It's okay if you close your eyes,
I'll be standin by your side,
I'm gonna love you the best that I can,
You're my heart and you're my best friend,
And I promise til the end, (yeah),

I'm gonna love you (gonna love you) the best that I can,

You're the views and the valleys,
You're not alone,
And when the worlds upside down,
You know, I'm there,
And anytime I feel afraid,
Thats when I look at you,

With the best that I can,
I will love you (I will love you),
The very best I can

(With every breath I take)
From this moment, til the very end,
I'm gonna love you (gonna love you) the best that I can (the best that I can),

It's okay if you close your eyes,

There's Us (Cover of Alez Johnson's Song)

There's me looking down at my shoes
The one smiling like the sun that's you
What were you thinking? 
What was the song inside your head?
There's us going on about a band 
Working out how we'd play our hands
I lay there dreaming later on alone in my bed 
If I was stupid maybe careless so were you

Not everything is supposed to come true 
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us 

Freeze frame I'm not about to cry
Its to late for us to change why try
I got a camera tucked away inside my heart
If I'm a loser or just unlucky so are you

Not everything is supposed to come true 
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us 

Somewhere between then and now
I looked away when you said we'll never change
And if you think we might have been 
You'll lose today and we've got songs to play

Not everything is supposed to come true 
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us 

Not everything is supposed to come true 
Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough there's us 
There's us 
There's us


It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, it always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know, is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

Ooh, I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues, of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is how I feel, when I look into your eyes

I promise you, from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am, ooh yeah

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night, I feel the tremble in your touch
Oh what I'm trying to say to you
I never said to anyone, "I promise"

I promise you, from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
(I do, my darling, I promise you)
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you)
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am, oh yeah
With everything I am


I said hey GIRL 
Did you hear me I said hey girl 
Why are you callin' now?

Chorus 2x


Beautiful you are

She is my dream come true
And in just two words, my destiny

Everything

Everything

Tu es intelligente et si jolie
Pourquoi vouloir défaire ta vie
Ne pense plus au mal
Ouvre grand ton fanal
Eclaire ton chemin
Et regarde droit devant

Et tout cela n'est pas fini
Tout ce que je veux
C'est de t'aider un peu
Je ne comprends pas
Pourquoi tu veux faire ça
Car la vie est si belle
Alors sois-y fidèle

You're an angel, so take your wings
And fly all over the sky
You'se so special, give you a chance
And fly without stopping

Tu es si aimable et si gentille
Ouvre grand tes yeux car ils brillent, yeah
Oublie ton passé
Commence a regarder
tout autour de toi
Le monde n'a pas de lois
Je promets que c'est pas fini
Penses-y avant d'agir
Je ne comprends pas
Pourquoi tu veux faire ça
Car la vie est si belle
Alors sois-y fidèle

You're an angel, so take your wings
And fly all over the sky
You'se so special, give you a chance
And fly without stopping

En ton nom
Je veux crier
Avertir les jeunes du monde entier
De pas se décourager
D'être bien supporté
Car nous sommes la pour toi
et nous voulons t'aider
Car la vie est si belle
Alors sois-y fidèle


You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

So many times I've been alone
I didn't know what to do
I don't know where I'd be
If I didn't have, I didn't have you
You comfort me
Make me believe
Give me the strength I need
Since you came into my life it's been so heavenly
Heavenly

You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

So many things I want to say to you
I'd give my all to you just because
You came around and gave me
All your, all your love
Now I'd sacrifice my very life
All you have to do is say the word
And there would never be no other

You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

You're the reason why I found my way
And you're the reason why I feel this way
And you're the reason why I have to sing
I had to let you know you're my everything

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
You're the reason
Ooh ooh
And you
You're the reason why I have a sing
Ooh you're my everything


Crossing the ocean with my window view.
Thinking of the time I spent with you.
And I close my eyes,
I see the family,
Making out their wish list,
All dressed up for Christmas.

On my own for too many years,
I miss the happiness.
I miss the tears.

When I close my eyes,
And I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas Day.

I see the children playing in the snow,
Precious memories I used to know.
Then I see the love in a mother's eyes,
Always there to teach us,
The real meaning of Christmas.
On my own for too many years,
I miss the happiness.
I miss the tears.

When I close my eyes,
And I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for too many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas.

It doesn't matter how old you think you are.
Something happens to you,
When you see that shining star.

When I close my eyes,
And I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas.

When I close my eyes,
And I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
I'm sending out a wire,
That this year,
I'll be home for Christmas Day.

CHOIR & 'N SYNC:
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, I'm comin' home.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, I'm comin' home,
One more time say oh...
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, I'm comin' home.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, I'm comin' home.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh yeah, I'm comin' home.


It's that time of year christmas is here
Everybody's back together again
Spreading the joy, spreading good cheer
Toasting to another year's end
So thankful for, all of our friends
When the party is over, the night's just begun
I promise the best part is yet to come
Slow dance together, two become one
That's what we've waited all day for

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night, under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
It's beautiful under my tree

The fire's aglow, we've got Nat King Cole
Singing us a song from his heart
Sleigh bells and snow makes us feel close to the stars
When carols are sung and the fire has died
The embers still burns with the love in our eyes
We cherish the moment, we savor the night
That's what we've waited all day for

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night, under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
It's beautiful under my tree

No one but me
No one but you
See rendez-vous (under my tree)
No one but me
No one but you

When the party is over, the night's just begun
I promise the best part is yet to come
We slow dance together, two become one
That's what we've waited all day for

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night
Under my tree (under my tree)
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
I wish that Santa could be here to see

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night, under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful under my tree

It's that time of year christmas is here
It's that time of year christmas is here
Full of love and good cheer


Fa la la Fa la la Fa la la la la la

Lookin back on childhood days
I can't believe my foolish ways
Thought that Christmas only came from the stores
And to know what was there for me,
Underneath the Christmas tree
Didn't know that there could be so much more
But in all of the rush
I was missin so much
Girl, you make me finally see

I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Until I looked into your eyes

Comin' home for the Holidays
Seein' friends from around the way
There was always something missin for me
On a sleigh ride caroling
Did it really mean anything?
Without that someone who can make it complete
While the snow's fallin down,
There was joy all around
Cuz girl, your love has shown me the way

I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Until I looked into your eyes

Fa la la Fa la la Fa la la la la la
Singin' la la la la la la la la la la la la
Fa la la Fa la la Fa la la la la la
Singin' la la la la la la la la la la la la
But in all of the rush
I was missin so much
Girl you make me finally see

I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Until I looked into your eyes

That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till I looked into your eyes

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols, being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Can help, to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep, tonight 

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies, on his sleigh
And every mother's child, is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know, how to fly

(Shoo be do whop do)

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids, from one to ninety-two
Although, its been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you 

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies, on his sleigh
And every mother's child, is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know, how to fly

(Shoo be do whop do)

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids, from one to ninety-two
Although, its been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

Merry Christmas


Feel the magic in the air
Christmas is all around
Somethin' about this special time of year
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky
Voices of angels
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time

Seein the face of the little boys and girls
Singing their First Noel
A sweet refrain heard all around the world
A song of forgiveness, comforting peace
A time to remember what life really means (Life really means)
The important things (Important things)

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time

Guess it's Christmas time
Open our hearts so we can open our arms

And we'll all join hands
To celebrate the goodness
That shines inside of everyone
It must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time

Must have been a part of some great design
Guess it's Christmas time
Merry Christmas


Snowy night
Where it's warm here by the fire
Here with you (here with you)
I have all that I desire
It's been a long year
But somehow we got by
Now it's Christmas Eve
And love is on our side

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree (the tree)
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me?
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (This Christmas, this Christmas)

Children sing (Children sing)
Christmas carols at our door (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Spreading joy (Spreading joy)
That's what Christmas time is for
Though we don't have much
You've got me and I've got you
And with a little faith
Miracles come true!

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree (the tree)
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me?
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (This Christmas, this Christmas)

I don't want the love of any other girl
I want only one thing in this whole wide world
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (this Christmas, this Christmas)

Cheek to cheek
The lights are low
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
Your face lit by the fire's glow
That's all I want tonight

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree (the tree)
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me?
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (This Christmas, this Christmas)

Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
Yes


Chorus:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

The first noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Chorus

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the herd
It gave grand light
And so it continued both day and night

Chorus

They spied, the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent and
To follow that star where ever it went

Chorus

Born is the King of Israel


Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way

Christmas time is so special (special, special)
When you're kissing me (under the, under the) under the mistletoe
Exchanging loving gifts
Sitting in front of the tree
Me holding you and you holding me

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

Last year, Christmas
It happened without us (out us out us)
I was all mixed up and confused
I didn't know what to do baby (What to do babe)
I never thought I'd feel this way
I always thought that Christmas was a happy day
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on his sleigh and send it my way

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

What a beautiful time (oh what a beautiful time it is)
Time it is
A time to open gifts, and play with all the kids
Yes, it's Christmas (Yes, it's Christmas)
Yes, it's Christmas time again (Christmas time again)
Girl I love you (girl I love u baby)
Yes, I love you (yes I love u baby)
It's Christmas time again (oh)
To be in love on Christmas (girl I love u baby, yes I love you baby)

What a beautiful time it is
Happy time to open gifts
Yes now it's Christmas time
And I am yours
And you are mine
Oh when you're kissin' me
Right under my Christmas tree
Baby come close to me
Cuz this is how it should be!

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

(Grandmamma, with my granddaddy, and my momma and my daddy I'm with you
On Christmas)


Ohhh, it's Christmas
Ohhhhhhh ahhhhhh

I'm so glad that you came my way
From a million stars
Here you are

Somehow I knew that you were made for me

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O holy night
O night divine
O holy night
O night divine
The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks(yonder breaks) a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine
Holy night
O holy night
Holy night
O Night divine
When Christ was born
Holy night when Christ was born


Mmm oooo

I know great distance still remains between us
But there's good reason to hold on
It's the happiest time of the year
Filled with laughter and good cheer
As you watch the snow
Sweet love, you'll hear me say

You've got my heart on Christmas
Inside my soul, your love remains
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

The days and weeks and months go by so slowly
We are both wishing it would fly oh
As the night begins to fall
Twilight drowns the bedroom cheer
Such a rush with joy (rush with joy)
And love, it comforts me
And I do believe

Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

A snowflake melts
In your eye it turns to a tear
But your cheek, it stays dry
With your warm smile so near
I have no fear
We're gonna make it
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo

Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day
(X3)


I was making my list
I was checking it twice
In the middle of this
I got tears in my eyes
For in my foolish heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you

I was trimming the tree
I was stringing the lights
While the radio played Silent Night
There were presents you sent
Though there were quite a few
The only gift I wanted was you

You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

As the bittersweet night
Had come to an end
I was saying goodbye
To our family and friends
And they all wished me well
And I knew that I knew
The only gift I wanted was you

You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
(la la la la la la)

The only gift I wanted was you
You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

I was making my list
I was checking it twice
In the middle of this
I got tears in my eyes
For in my wishful heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you


Ohh yeah
Yeah
Kiss me at midnight
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Kiss me at midnight
Dance into the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here and when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss
I've been waiting for this special night
To be with you
The colors of Christmas are still shining bright
And I know what we're gonna do
Anticipatin'
Music is playin
The magic is in the air
All through the season
You've been the reason
I have so much love to share

Kiss me at midnight
Dance into the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here and when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss
Kiss me at midnight
Kiss
We've been makin' promises in the dark
Our resolutions
As a brand New Year is about to start
We're together
Celebratin'
No more waiting
Our time has arrived
Feel the beat of my heart (Beat of my heart)
As the countdown starts (Countdown starts)
Just look into my eyes

Kiss me at midnight
Dance into the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here and when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Baby it's New Year's Eve
A time we can believe
In makin' wishes
Dreams come true
Just for me and you

Kiss me at midnight
Dance into the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here and when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss me at midnight
Dance into the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here and when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight

Kiss me at midnight
Dance into the morning light
Party into the New Year
All of my friends are here and when the timing's right
Kiss me at midnight


It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Hey, yeah

Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Trying too much, but, baby, we can't win

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain

You drive a pretty car, you know how fine you are
And nobody needs to say it, no way
They love the clothes you wear, they compliment you
And I just love the way you play it

Can this be true?
Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel
It's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

In all of creations all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

On you, on you, on you, you

So tell me what you do now

You sheltered me from harm 
You kept me warm, you kept me warm 
You gave my life to me, 
You set me free, you set me free 
The finest years I ever knew 
Were all the years I had with you 

I would give anything I own, 
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own, 
Just to have you back again 

You taught me how to love, 
What its of, what its of 
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you, 
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

I would give everything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own 
Just to have you back again 

Is there someone you know,
Loving them so,
Yut taking them all for granted. 
You may lose them one day, 
Someone takes them away, 
And they don't hear the words you long to say 

Ev-ry-thing I own...{Reapeat about 2 X's}

I would give anything I own,
Everything I own, Nobidy can love love love like I do 

I would give everything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own 
Just to have you back again 

I would give everything I own 
Just to have you back again
Just to have you, back again...


Lying in your arms so close together
Didn't know just what I had 
Now I toss and turn cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head? Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark 

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool, I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
(Just how good you were to me)
You confessed your love
(You confessed your love)
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free
And now I'm left with all this pain
I only got myself to blame, no

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy

And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see

It's impossible to find

I'm, I'm out to find the solving key
To this woman's mystery

From delirious I'm running
Tell me, where's this source of magic
This hide-and-seek makes me an addict

I woke up this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
Closed my eyes and I slipped away
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(More than a feeling)
(More than a feeling)
Well it's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
Till I see Mary Anne walk away

When I'm tired and I think I'm cold
I hide in my music and forget the day
And dream of a girl that I used to know
Close my eyes and she slipped away
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(More than a feeling)
(More than a feeling)
Well it's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
Till I see Mary Anne walk away

Well it's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
Till I see Mary Anne walk away

Close my eyes and slip away

You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what you do now
'Cause (I, I, I, I, I,) I want you back

It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well, for sure

So don't hang up the phone now

I'm going crazy without you

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeaheaheah
So tell me what to do now

So tell me why you had to go
Was it me, I need to know

What can I do to make you see
That I'm here, here for you
I really hope that you'll come home
So we can be together again

What can I do (what can I do)
To make you see (to make you see)
That I'm here (I'm here)
Here for you (I'm here for you)
I really hope (I really hope)
That you'll come home (that you'll come home)
So we can be (so we can be)
Together again (together again)

Ooh...together again
Ooh...together again


Forever young, forever young...

Let us live eternally
We can reach our destiny
We will feast in harmony as one
Forever young
(Forever, forever, forever)
Though they teach us sacrifice (sacrifice)
We will never compromise
(Forever young)
We are here until our work is done
(Forever, forever, forever)

Forever young, forever young...

Whatever may come falling down
Will never break our solid ground
A million hours until the game is won
Forever young
(Forever, forever, forever)
Until we've learned what love can bring
Well our immortal voice will ring
(Forever young)
And through the clouds we'll always find the sun
(Forever, forever, forever)

Forever young, forever young...

Baby, yeah
We're the future of the world
With love let's take our stand
For all that we believe
Forever ever young
Forever young

(Forever young)
Forever young, forever

Forever young, forever young...
Forever young, forever young...


She stood out just like a diamond lady
Amongst the tourists in a crowded room
I took her walking on the sandy beaches
Under a silver Caribbean moon that's when she...

Promised that and I promised this
And till this day I can still picture it
She took my hand and I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss

Sundreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Sundreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget

Every day just seemed to go too quickly
And every night just passed us in a blur
I never noticed the blue skies and waters
Because I only had eyes for her

And so when she promised that and I promised this 
And to this day I can still picture it 
She took my hand and I took her kiss 
So temporary these moments of bliss

Sundreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Sundreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget

Roll back
(Those crazy summer days)
Stroll back
(I'll find you through the haze)

Sundreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Sundreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget

Sundreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Sundreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget
(until fade)


Absulute horror
Darkness

Yeah
Yeah
Oh yes
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

Can this be true?
Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel
It's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

In all of creations all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

On you, on you, on you, you
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yes he did baby)
On you, on you, on you, you
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yeah)

Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me?
There's an angel
It's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

God must have spent(on you, on you, on you, you)
A little more time
On you...

(Yeah)
A little more time
On you


Lying in your arms so close together
Didn't know just what I had 
Now I toss and turn cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head? Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark 

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool, I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
(Just how good you were to me)
You confessed your love
(You confessed your love)
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free
And now I'm left with all this pain
I only got myself to blame, no

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

Why didn't I know?

You sheltered me from harm 
You kept me warm, you kept me warm 
You gave my life to me, 
You set me free, you set me free 
The finest years I ever knew 
Were all the years I had with you 

I would give anything I own, 
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own, 
Just to have you back again 

You taught me how to love, 
What its of, what its of 
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you, 
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

I would give everything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own 
Just to have you back again 

Is there someone you know,
Loving them so,
Yut taking them all for granted. 
You may lose them one day, 
Someone takes them away, 
And they don't hear the words you long to say 

Ev-ry-thing I own...{Reapeat about 2 X's}

I would give anything I own,
Everything I own, Nobidy can love love love like I do 

I would give everything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home

Just to have you back again

Just to have you back again
Just to have you, back again...

Snowy night
Where it's warm here by the fire
Here with you (here with you)
I have all that I desire
It's been a long year
But somehow we got by
Now it's Christmas Eve
And love is on our side

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree (the tree)
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me?
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (This Christmas, this Christmas)

Children sing (Children sing)
Christmas carols at our door (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Spreading joy (Spreading joy)
That's what Christmas time is for
Though we don't have much
You've got me and I've got you
And with a little faith
Miracles come true!

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree (the tree)
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me?
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (This Christmas, this Christmas)

I don't want the love of any other girl
I want only one thing in this whole wide world
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (this Christmas, this Christmas)

Cheek to cheek
The lights are low
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
Your face lit by the fire's glow
That's all I want tonight

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree (the tree)
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me?
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas (This Christmas, this Christmas)

Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
Yes


It's that time of year christmas is here
Everybody's back together again
Spreading the joy, spreading good cheer
Toasting to another year's end
So thankful for, all of our friends
When the party is over, the night's just begun
I promise the best part is yet to come
Slow dance together, two become one
That's what we've waited all day for

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night, under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
It's beautiful under my tree

The fire's aglow, we've got Nat King Cole
Singing us a song from his heart
Sleigh bells and snow makes us feel close to the stars
When carols are sung and the fire has died
The embers still burns with the love in our eyes
We cherish the moment, we savor the night
That's what we've waited all day for

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night, under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
It's beautiful under my tree

No one but me
No one but you
See rendez-vous (under my tree)
No one but me
No one but you

When the party is over, the night's just begun
I promise the best part is yet to come
We slow dance together, two become one
That's what we've waited all day for

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night
Under my tree (under my tree)
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
I wish that Santa could be here to see

No one else but me and you
Nothing I would rather do
Then hold you all through the night, under my tree
Bring along the mistletoe
Keep the music nice and low
I'll show you how good it could be
I wish that Santa could be here to see
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful under my tree

It's that time of year christmas is here
It's that time of year christmas is here
Full of love and good cheer


Mmm oooo

I know great distance still remains between us
But there's good reason to hold on
It's the happiest time of the year
Filled with laughter and good cheer
As you watch the snow
Sweet love, you'll hear me say

You've got my heart on Christmas
Inside my soul, your love remains
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

The days and weeks and months go by so slowly
We are both wishing it would fly oh
As the night begins to fall
Twilight drowns the bedroom cheer
Such a rush with joy (rush with joy)
And love, it comforts me
And I do believe

Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

A snowflake melts
In your eye it turns to a tear
But your cheek, it stays dry
With your warm smile so near
I have no fear
We're gonna make it
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo

Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day
(X3)


Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way

Christmas time is so special (special, special)
When you're kissing me (under the, under the) under the mistletoe
Exchanging loving gifts
Sitting in front of the tree
Me holding you and you holding me

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

Last year, Christmas
It happened without us (out us out us)
I was all mixed up and confused
I didn't know what to do baby (What to do babe)
I never thought I'd feel this way
I always thought that Christmas was a happy day
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on his sleigh and send it my way

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

What a beautiful time (oh what a beautiful time it is)
Time it is
A time to open gifts, and play with all the kids
Yes, it's Christmas (Yes, it's Christmas)
Yes, it's Christmas time again (Christmas time again)
Girl I love you (girl I love u baby)
Yes, I love you (yes I love u baby)
It's Christmas time again (oh)
To be in love on Christmas (girl I love u baby, yes I love you baby)

What a beautiful time it is
Happy time to open gifts
Yes now it's Christmas time
And I am yours
And you are mine
Oh when you're kissin' me
Right under my Christmas tree
Baby come close to me
Cuz this is how it should be!

Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling
Wishing, I pray, to be in love on Christmas
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas

(Grandmamma, with my granddaddy, and my momma and my daddy I'm with you
On Christmas)


Chorus:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

The first noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Chorus

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the herd
It gave grand light
And so it continued both day and night

Chorus

They spied, the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent and
To follow that star where ever it went

Chorus

Born is the King of Israel


Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye

I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on

I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Just hit me with the truth
Girl, you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby, come on

I lived for you and me
And now I've really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm givin' up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more (Bye, bye)
I'm checking out I'm signing off
I don't wannna be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind

Bye, bye, bye
I don't wanna make it tough (Make it tough)
But I've had enough
And it ain't no lie, bye, bye

I don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
I don't wanna be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye


''It's gonna be me''
Oooh, yeah

You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh oh

I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste

You're just too blind ''(too blind)'' to see
But in the end you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody ''(somebody)''
Guess what ''(guess what)''
It's gonna be me

''It's gonna be me''
Ooh, yeah

There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see
It's gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna
It's gonna be me

All that I do
Is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like that

When finally ''(finally)''
You get to love
Guess what ''(guess what)''

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you ''(for you, baby)''
You don't wanna lose it again ''(don't wanna lose it)''
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody ''(love)''
Guess what ''(guess what)''
It's gonna be me

Every little thing I do ''(oh oh)''
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again ''(don't wanna lose it)''
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what ''(guess what)''
It's gonna be me


Here it comes, millennium
And everybody's talkin' 'bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or the beginning of the end
Well, I've got other thoughts my friend
See I've got my eyes on the skies
The heavenly bodies up high
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
Then strap on a suit and get inside

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay

We don't need all these prophesies
Tellin' us what's a sign, what's a sign
'Cause paranoia ain't the way to live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and your fears behind
Don't be afraid at all
'Cause up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and your body to the test
'Cause up in outer space it's like the wild wild west

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo

(Rap)
Boom and never let you try to stop me
Born to fly sky high, up to the top see
Nothing to fear, no doubts and no tears
Millennium sound to motivate the future years
And you can either be scared or get prepared
Against all odds I bet you never woud've dared
To make these moves and take flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy
Space connect to overthrow you interception
Ready or not, make it hot there ain't  no question
Get *NSYNC and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith one love from Left Eye

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Why-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo   (x2)

Ehhh, I'm broke


I was hanging with the fellas
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous
I was hoping that I'd never see you with him
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him
Heh
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none
And I can tell by looking that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked
His style is wack, clothes are bad
Come on, girl, let him go
I want you back

Call me a hater, if you want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
You say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to
That's true I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside
'Cause I can't see you with another guy

It makes me Ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
Oh, it makes me Ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him

Girl I know that we broke up
But that doesn't mean you should give the cold shoulder
'Cause you know that I truly do adore ya
And that other guy can't do nothin' for ya
Uh see
I can tell that you don't really love that guy
So there's no need for you to go and waste your time
I think you know I love ya more
Girl you gotta let him go
I want you so just give him the boot

Call me a hater, if you want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
You can say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to
That's true I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside
'Cause I can't see you with another guy

It makes me Ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
Oh, it makes me Ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him

Ohhhhhhhh

Used to be (my girl) Used to be my girl yeahhh
It makes me Ill (oooo) cause she used to be my girl (c'mon)
My girl
So baby come back to me (baaaaaby)

It makes me Ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will (at his willll)
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him (when I see you with him)
Oh, it makes me Ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will (at his will)
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh(x4)

What!, We don, done it again! Meeerrrrrccyyyyy! oh!
(laughter of the guys) aha oh


Ooh, ooh

When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you, are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call, was standing here all along

And I will take, you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever, in lifetimes before
And I promise you never, will you hurt anymore
I give you my word, I give you my heart (I give you my heart)
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow forever has now begun

Just close your eyes, each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away, no
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you
This I promise you

Over and over I fall, (over and over I fall), when I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all

And I will take, (I will take you in my arms), you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you babe

Just close your eyes, each loving day (each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away, (no)
Every word I say is true, this I promise you

Every word I say is true, this I promise you

Ooh I promise you


Baby you're not the only one
Ooh yeah, hey yeah

I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he put you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone
Take it from me, it's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me, see I would give you love
The kind of love that you only dream of

Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it here's my heart
No Strings Attached

He doesn't give you the kind of attention
That a girl like you needs(that a girl like you needs)
'Cause he always looks around, his eyes wander around
He doesn't see you like I see, yeah
Take it from me, it's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me, baby I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of

Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it here's my heart
No Strings Attached

Take it from me, it's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take if from me, see I would give you love
The kind of love you've only dreamed of
So if you take a chance with me
If you take a chance with me
I'll be your everything you need, everything you need
Because it's our destiny, oh

Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it here's my heart
No Strings Attached (x2)

I never thought you were a fair-weather friend
You never let me down, you're true to the end
For in the darkest hour when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me and for you

And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losingyou)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...

I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive, I could never forget
Cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
Told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth

And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you(losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's eyes

And so we can't forget
We've got to keep remembering
Them all(them all)
The ones who took the fall
They did it for us all

And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
You've got to face the world, be strong

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through ( things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you ( losing you )
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday) Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...

Through a lovers eyes.

Could it be you
Can you imagine what it's like to always live without love
I need to have you in my life

My open heart (open heart)
Make you a part (make you apart)
A part of this lovin I've been keepin (i've been keeping for)
And I might just give it all to you
Oh ho

Tell me, How could I have been so blind?
You were here all the time
Could it be you?
The girl I always have dreams about
The one I just can't live without
Is it so tell me now

Every girl I meet
Though they might be sweet
They can't compare to you
So I search no more what I'm looking for
I know I found in you

Could it be you?
I've been searching so hard to find
Tell me how could I have been so blind
You were here all the time
Could it be you?

The girl I always have dreams about
The one I just can't live without

If I'm not the one you want (then who;s he)
Take your time to figure out.. (and you'll see)

Hey yeah

I'm staring at your picture every night
The scent of you still lingers in my mind.
I wonder if you're alone and feel alright
And the sun has come out of the clouds.

And sometimes when I listen to our song
The night seems so cold and far too long.
I wanna call you up cause in the end
I keep writing letters to my garbage can.

Lately, feels like I'm going crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me.

Chorus: If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need.

I feel like it's on you I can depend
Wish I could turn back the hands of time.
Enough of building castles in the sand.
Why can't we be forever?

Lately, feels like I'm going crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me.

If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need).

If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need.

Somewhere, in the back of my mind (back of my mind)
I know that you will be mine (you will be mine).
Somehow, wish I could rewind (I could rewind)
And leave all the worries behind..

If I'm not the one you want
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need).
Take your time to figure out
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need).

If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need).

I'll be the one you need..!

Tired of feelin' all around me animosity

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

(Lately) I've been doing a little thinkin' 'bout the things that satisfy you
It's making me wonder 'bout the things that you see in me
I hate the way you like to say your man's a celebrity
Baby what's the deal, I thought you wanted me for me

(You gotta) say what you mean
(You gotta) mean what you say
('Cause you keep) pushin' me away
'Cause I ain't got no time to play, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity (x4)

(I'm glad that you) are having a good time livin' the life that I've laid out for me
Constantly splurgin', spending my money on everything you see
See it would be diferent if you had something maybe like a J-O-B
You need to get your thing together, yeah

(You gotta) stop runnin' games 
(Sayin')it ain't about my fame
('Cause you know) if things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

If you really loved me, you'd try and show me it ain't even about my name
But you try to use me, you lie to fool me
So it can never be the same 
So now I'm leaving you behind
I've found somebody who can love me for me
And that's all I need, yeah

Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity (x4)

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity (x3)

You got caught up in  your lies (in your lies)

Take it personal 'cause I did when you cheated on me
You may be beautiful but there's more that the eye can't see
You're so predictable the way you calculate each move
Heads I win, tails you lose because you don't have the right to choose
'Cause you tried to play both sides (both sides)
You got caught up in your lies (in your lies)
And now you're running, you're running out of time (yeah)

Girl when we started baby we were friends
But that's not how this fairy tale is gonna end
See I was thinking then it clicked one day

That no one else has ever made me feel this way
Next time I saw you girl I knew I had to try
To tell you everything that I was feeling deep inside
And listen good 'cause what I say is from my heart
So if you're ready

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care this I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us

Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through
I sent you flowers on a Saturday (Saturday)
Inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling, knowing that I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way about someone in quite awhile
Just listen to these words I have to say (ooh)
Just take a chance (take a chance)

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone
And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call 'cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl it's just the two of us
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us, the two of us
'Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there telling you I care this I swear
Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us

It just gets better with each day (maybe someday)
I always wanted to tell you but I was so afraid

And I just can't wait 'til you get home
Waiting for your call (waiting for your call)
'Cause tonight we're gonna do it all(gonna do it all)

Girl it's just the two of us, the two of us

Oh

Hey yea yeah


There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange mhhmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

Now,I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no,no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day 
But baby I don't want to 

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

What will I do if I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to baby who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart? 
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong

I said why, I said why (Why)
Oh oh oh
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me ...
Oh, oh ... yeah

We were born the same day
We even think the same way
It couldn't be more right
We are what they call a perfect match
It's something that you can't touch
Down to the last bone, you're my baby
But to be honest
There's just one thing
A part that is missing
You don't seem to care at all

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how(how)
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?
Why, tell me, my baby

Now from the moment we met
I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong
Now I'm hearing that you're seeing someone new
And I wanna know who
But does he love you like I do my baby
But I promise you this one thing
Whatever that's missing
I will make it up to you
So tell me baby

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how(how)
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?
Why, tell me, my baby

Gettin under my skin
For messing up my mind
For never letting me into your life and
Tell me baby how come you don't wanna love me
And am how am I supposed to live without
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too
You....

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
We were born the same day
We even think the same way
We are what they all call a perfect match
Tell me, baby

Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?

You know we don't care at all
Let, let me see you up, up against the wall

Two step

I was just doin' my thing
Hanging out at the spot you know the place we go
The music sure plays hot and everybody was feeling the DJ
Smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights went low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me so and you know what happens now
The girl was fine and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all we started grinding
Shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow you know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
You know we don't care at all
(Just get caught up when you're up against the wall)
We don't, we don't care at all
(You know we don't care at all, let, let me see you up, up against the wall)

It's almost 2 o'clock it's time to make my move
The after hours spot is where I'm going to
'Cause I gotta have some more
Looking for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eyeing me
The lights are low and her friends were all around
I walked up to her so and you know what happens now
She turned around and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

She took my hand we never said a word at all
We started grinding shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow you know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
She already had me up against the wall

Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the cutest one you saw?
She's underneath the disco ball, the disco ball? the disco ball
Standing next to strobe lights, dancin' hot, lookin' tight
The freaks sure do come out at night, out at night, night, night, night
What more (whoo) do I have to say?

Two step

She took my hand we never said a word at all
We started grinding shorty had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow you know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall (x2)

We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
That that we see you up, up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
Just get caught up when you're up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all
You know we don't care at all
That that we see you up, up against the wall

When he leaves you don't come crying back to me
'Cause I'll be moving on you see and you'll be just a memory

But I swear I'll give you so much more

And I can't help myself babe

And my heart gets no rest over you

But all I want is your love
You can call me hopless, baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect? 
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you
So what's wrong with being selfish?
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'll be taking up your time
Till the day I make you realize (realize)
That for you their could be no one else
I just gotta have you for myself
Baby I would take good care of you
No matter what it is you're going through
I'll be there for you when you're in need
Baby believe in me
'Cause if love is a crime, hey yeah
Then punish me, I would die for you
'Cause I don't want to live without you
What can I do?

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
You can call me hopeless, baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you

Why do you keep us apart?
Why won't you give up your heart?
You know that we're meant to be together
Why do you push me away?
All that I want is to give you love
Forever and ever and ever

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
You can call me hopless, baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect?
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you

Selfishly I'm in love with you
'Cause I've searched my soul
And I know that it's you
Selfishly I'm in love with you
'Cause I've searched my soul
And I know that it's you
Selfishly I'm in love with you
'Cause I've searched my soul
And I know that it's you
Selfishly I'm in love with you
'Cause I've searched my soul
And I know that it's you


Oh oh...No no...All right

You like to be seen at every party at the Playboy Mansion
Fun....sad, I know I gotta draw the line
You wanna be in the flashes of light, holding me tight
With your phoney laugh, I guess you gotta be photographed

You can say it's real but I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have to tell me that it's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that

You like to drive in my Jag and spend every dollar of my credit, baby
Guess what? Hit me with your golden eye
I guess you wanna be part of the ride, live for the night
But I've seen it through, I've had enough of being close to you

You can say it's real but I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have to tell me that it's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that

No, no...It's not about love...No no

You wanna be in the flashes of light, holding me tight
Girl, it's all up to you
But whatever you do, I don't wanna hear it

You're not gonna love me
I won't go for that, it just won't happen
Even if you say, you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that

You are gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You were gonna tell me that it's gonna be your last lie
No, no baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say, you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that


So many times
I thought I held it in my hands
But just like grains of sand
Love slipped through my fingers

So many nights
I asked the Lord above
Please make me lucky enough
To find a love that lingers

Something keeps telling me
You could be my answered prayer
You must be heaven sent
I swear

'Cause something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak
Could it be true this is what God has meant for me
'Cause baby I can't believe that something like you
Could happen to me

(Something like you...ooh ooh)

Girl in your eyes
I feel your fire burn (feel your fire burn)
All your secrets I will learn
Even if it takes forever

With you by my side
I can do anything (can do anything)
I don't care what tomorrow brings
As long as we're together

My heart is telling me
That you could be my meant to be
I know it more each time
We touch 'cause

'Cause something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak
Could it be true this is what God has meant for me
'Cause baby I can't believe that something like you
Could happen to me

Something magical (something magical)
Something spiritual (something spiritual)
Something stronger than the two of us alone (yeah)
Something physical
Something undeniable
Nothing like anything (anything)
That I've ever known

'Cause something happens when you look at me
I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth
My knees get so weak
Could it be true this is what God has meant for me
'Cause baby I can't believe that something like you
Could happen to me

Oh ooh

When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surround you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing here all along

(Chorus 1)
And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow
Forever has now begun

(Chorus 2)
Just close your eyes
Each lovin' day
And know this feeling won't go away
'Til the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you

Over and over I fall
When I hear you call
Without you in my life, baby
I just wouldn't be living at all

(Chorus 3)
And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through
This I promise you, baby

Just close your eyes
Each lovin' day
And know this feeling won't go away
Every word I say is true
This I promise you
Every word I say is true
This I promise you
Ooh, I promise you


''It's gonna be me''
Oooh, yeah

You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh oh

I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste

You're just too blind ''(too blind)'' to see
But in the end you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody ''(somebody)''
Guess what ''(guess what)''
It's gonna be me

''It's gonna be me''
Ooh, yeah

There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see
It's gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna

All that I do
Is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like that

When finally ''(finally)''
You get to love

Can this be true?
Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel
It's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

In all of creations all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

On you, on you, on you, you
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yes he did baby)
On you, on you, on you, you
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yeah)

Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me?
There's an angel
It's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

God must have spent(on you, on you, on you, you)
A little more time
On you...

(Yeah)
A little more time
On you


You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what you do now
'Cause (I, I, I, I, I,) I want you back

It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well, for sure

So don't hang up the phone now
I'm trying to figure out just what to do
I'm going crazy without you

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeaheaheah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

Baby, I remember
The way you used to look at me and say
Promises never last forever

I told you not to worry
I said that everything will be alright
I didn't know than that you were right

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeaheaheah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

(I) I want you back
Ohoho

You're the one I need
Girl, what can I do?

You're all I ever needed (You're the one I need)
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange mhhmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

Now,I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no,no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day 
But baby I don't want to 

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

What will I do if I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to baby who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart? 
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Hey, yeah

Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Trying too much, but, baby, we can't win

Ohohoho
Oho

Lying in your arms, so close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn 'cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad

Where was my head, where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do (Wanting you the way that I do)

Ooohooo

I was such a fool, I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me (Just how good you were to me)
You confessed your love (You confessed your love), undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free

And now I'm left with all this pain
I've only got myself to blame

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do (Wanting you the way that I do)

Why didn't I know it? (How much I loved you, baby)

You'll never know what you've done for me
Put your faith in me has done for my soul
And you'll never know the gift you've given me
I'll carry it with me
Through the days ahead I'll think of days before
You made me hope for something better,
And made me reach for something more

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

You were the one
Always on my side (always on my side)
Always standing by (always standing by)
Seeing me through
You were the song that always made me sing (made me sing, made me sing)
I'm singin this for you (singin this for you baby)
Everywhere I go I'll think of where I've been
And of the one who knew me better than anyone ever will again

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

What you taught me
Only your love could ever teach me
You got through when no one could reach me before
'cuz you always saw in me
All the best that I could be
It was you who set me free

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes, you've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

...Is the music of my heart...

Cuando sientas tristeza
Que no puedas calmar
Cuando haya un vacío
Que no puedas llenar
Te abrazaré
Te haré olvidar
Lo que te hizo sufrir
No vas a caer
Mientras que estés junto a mi

Si siente un frío tu corazón
Seré tu abrigo, tu ilusión
Hasta ya no respirar
Yo te voy amar
Yo te voy amar

Yo siempre te he amado
Y, amor, yo estaré
Por siempre a tu lado
Nunca me alejaré
Prometo mi amor
Te juro ante Dios

You're on my mind, I'm going crazy
You are the cure and you know but you don't care
Girl you driving me insane

You can say what you want to
Do what you wanna do
As long as you love me, girl, I won't front you
You're the sweetest thing
Let me be your man
Let me hold your hand
Or let me be your friend
Meanwhile I will set the house
Up on hill
Girl as you know it's all about the dollar-bill
Gonna treat you like a queen
Like a lady
Chica, chico, you drive me crazy...

You're always on my mind
Need you all the time
So come and get with me
'Cause darlin' you're the one I need
Someone to hold me tight
'Cause I can't sleep at night
You are my fantasy
Girl you drive me crazy

You drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind
You drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies
You drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
You drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free


If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

(Lately) I've been doing a little thinkin' 'bout the things that satisfy you
It's making me wonder 'bout the things that you see in me
I hate the way you like to say your man's a celebrity
Baby what's the deal, I thought you wanted me for me

(You gotta) say what you mean
(You gotta) mean what you say
('Cause you keep) pushin' me away
'Cause I ain't got no time to play, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity (x4)

(I'm glad that you) are having a good time livin' the life that I've laid out for me
Constantly splurgin', spending my money on everything you see
See it would be diferent if you had something maybe like a J-O-B
You need to get your thing together, yeah

(You gotta) stop runnin' games 
(Sayin')it ain't about my fame
('Cause you know) if things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

If you really loved me, you'd try and show me it ain't even about my name
But you try to use me, you lie to fool me
So it can never be the same 
So now I'm leaving you behind
I've found somebody who can love me for me
And that's all I need, yeah

Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity, Celebrity (x4)

If I wasn't a celebrity 
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity (x3)


I just don't understand
Why you running from a good man, baby
Why you wanna turn your back on love
And Why you've already given up
See I know you've been hurt before
But I swear I'll give you so much more
I swear I'll never let you down
'Cause I swear it's you that I adore
And I can't help myself babe
'Cause I think about you constantly
And my heart gets no rest over you

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
You can call me hopless, baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect? 
Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you
So what's wrong with being selfish?
Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'll be taking up your time
Till the day I make you realize (realize)
That for you their could be no one else
I just gotta have you for myself
Baby I would take good care of you
No matter what it is you're going through
I'll be there for you when you're in need
Baby believe in me
'Cause if love is a crime, hey yeah
Then punish me, I would die for you
'Cause I don't want to live without you
What can I do?

You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
You can call me hopeless, baby
'Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect?

Wherever I go, whatever I do
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

It's not easy to be alone
It's not easy to fall in love
Every night I just get down and pray
That you come my way, yeah

I've never had a girl like you
(Girl like you)
I've never known what love could do
Wish you'd come, baby and set me free
I can't let it be, yeah

Wherever I go, whatever I do
Whenever my heart is crying out for you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'm crazy for you

I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true
I wanna, I wanna rock with you
I'm crazy for you

I'm waiting for the phone to ring
And all the wonder love should bring
All the things, darling I left behind
Please give me a sign

A little smile would light my life
And a single touch would blow my mind
Girl you know, by now you've got to be mine
Till the end of time

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange mhhmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

Now,I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no,no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day 
But baby I don't want to 

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

What will I do if I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to baby who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart? 
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains
But the truth remains
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

But the truth remains you're...

(That's the way love goes...)
Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire,
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire,
(That's the way love goes...)
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire,
(That's the way love goes...)

Don't mind if I light candles
I like to watch us play and
Baby, I've got on what I like...
Come closer
Baby closer
Reach out and feel my body
I'm gonna give you all my love...
Oh sugar don't you hurry
You've got me here all night
Just close your eyes and hold on tight...
(Oh baby)
Don't stop, don't stop
Go deeper
Baby deeper
You feel so good I'm gonna cry...
Oooooh,

Good morning mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

I see you every morning
Outside the restaurant
The music plays so nonchalant

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again.

How deep is your love 
How deep is your love
I really need to love
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
And they should all just let us be
We belong to you and me
[da da da da da da da da da]
How deep is your love

Well you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music loud and my feelin's warm
I can do you right since I was born
And now it's all right that's okay
You may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
People stayin' alive stayin' alive
Ah ah ah ah stayin' alive stayin' alive
Ah ah ah ah stayin' alive [yeah]
I'm stayin' alive


Yeah
Oh yes
Oh yeah
Can this be true? 
Tell me, can this be real? 
How can I put into words what I feel? 
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control? 
I never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? 
It's a miracle...

Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret
That I could never keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must of spent...
A little more time
On you...
(a little more time, yes he did baby)

In all of creation
All things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than
Any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold
When you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile

The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Leaves me purified

Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep (and deep)
Your soul is like a secret
That I could never keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must of spent...
A little more time
On you...
(on you, on you, on you, you....on you, on you, on you, you..) ohhh...
(on you, on you, on you, you....on you, on you, on you, you..) yeah...

Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? 
It's a miracle...

Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep (peaceful and deep)
Your soul is like a secret
That I could never keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must of spent...
A little more time
On you...
(on you, on you, on you, you..)
God must of spent...
A little more time
On you
(on you, on you..you....you..oooh..yeah)
A little more time
On you...ohhh


(lil intro: music to "I Got You Babe" by Sonny & Cher)

Whoaahhh yeah yeah yeah
(what happened)
Yeah-ayyyyeee
(i don't get it)
Why, baby, whyyyy?

I fell in love
I thought you felt the same
But when I saw you with him
I knew it was your game

You kissed my lips
We shared those times
But when you found out how I felt
You said you wouldn't be mine

CHORUS
What did I do?
Was it just me?
I feel like I am in too deep
And I know... that without you
It'll be a long road ahead

My friends call me up
I don't know what to do
I guess they just don't get it
I don't wanna live without you

CHORUS

BRIDGE
From this torture I wish I could be free
I don't know how you could do this to me...

CHORUS (2X)

(Sonny & Cher: "I got...... you babe")


If I was down
Would your arms lift me up to higher ground
With just the strength of your love
I was lost
But I find something in your eyes to lead me home

And if it all went wrong
Would you be there to hold
It's easy to be there through the good times
But when the times get hard
Would you stay or walk away

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear you'll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there
Will you stand by my side through the bad times
Through whatever we'll be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there

When I need someone to hold
Someone there for me
Are you gonna be there

In all my world
If it should all fall down
Will you be there
Be there to turn it around
Will you still care
Can I depend on you to see me through this life
If it all goes wrong
Will you still make it right

It's easy to be there through the good times
But when the times get hard
Will you still be on my side

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear you'll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there
Will you stand by my side through the bad times
Through whatever we'll be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there

When I need someone beside me
Someone there for me
Are you gonna be
There with the arms to hold me
There with the love I need
(There with the love all that I need)
Then will you be there
Will you be there
Heart and soul
I need to know

Are you gonna be there
Are you gonna still care
(Are you gonna still care)
Are you gonna be... yeah

Will you stand by my side
(Stand by my side)
Are you gonna be mine
Are you gonna be there
(Are you gonna be there)

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear you'll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there
Will you stand by my side through the bad times
Through whatever we'll be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there

Are you gonna be there when the rain comes
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch
Can you swear you'll be there with a real love
Are you gonna be there
Will you stand by my side through the bad times
Through whatever we'll be will you still be mine
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime
Are you gonna be there


Stand By Me

(Tim McGraw)
When the night has come,
And the land is dark.
And the moon,
Is the only light we'll see.

Stand, stand by me.

If the sky 
That we look upon,
Should tumble and fall.
Or the mountain,
Should crumble to the sea.

(Chris)
I won't cry, I won't cry.
No I won't shed a tear.
Just as long
As you stand
Stand by me.

(All)
So darlin', darlin'
Stand, by me.
Ohhhh stand by me.
Woahh stand now,
Stand by me.

Suzanne, the plans they made made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

(Justin)
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way.. oh yea

(All)

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby just one more time

Lean On Me

Jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah

So misunderstood, yeah

You're really no good

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
And they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Do, do, do, do
How deep is your love
Do, do
How deep is your
Do, do, do, do
How deep is your love
Do, do, do, do
How deep is your love

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music's loud and feeling's warm
I've been doing it right since I was born
But that's all right
That's OK
We can look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
People stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Yeah
I'm staying alive


Oh you can be what you wanna be
See what you wanna see
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself
You can go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself

Some folks try to tell you there are things you shouldn't do
But you're not strong enough, or smart enough at all
But what seems right to them ,quite often might be wrong for you
So be sure you try to climb before you get to scare you'll fall

You can be what you wanna be
Learn what you wanna learn
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself
You can try what you need to try
No one should question why
Believe in yourself, just belive in yourself

Folks may say you're different
That you've gone and lost your senses
But the world is your to walk
Go ahead and leave the fences
And you'll see( and you'll see)
Belive in yourself
And the world belongs to you
You and me
And the world belongs to you and me

Keep going 
Cause you know that I 

*CHORUS*

Born is the king of Israel

The first noel the angels did say
Was to certain for shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winters night
That was so deep

Noel 
Noel
Noel 
Noel
Born is the king of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the herd it gave grand light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel 
Noel
Noel 
Noel
Born is the king of Israel

Despite the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far
To seek for the king was their intent
And to follow that star wherever it went

Born is the king of Israel

Born is the King of Israel

In the middle of the night

Ready to scrap when I say

I take the hips off Trina
The lips off Eve

I put ya so high on a pedestal, it might make ya nose bleed
So much ice around ya ankles and watch ya toes freeze
What's wrong, ma? Ya man ain't bringing ya joy?
Don't trip flip ya scrip to a country boy
Now c'mon

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah

And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend, oh

(CHORUS repeat to fade)


Here and now
Is the way I live
Unafraid of what life gives

And there' ve been times in my life
I couldn't see a difference
In pain or in joy, or in sun or in rain
They just seem the same

But I'm only human
Branded by my ambitions
But I'm going to make it count

Here and now
Is the way I live
With an open heart and mind
(Here and now)

So many intentions
In life I could have followed
But one of those paths must lead to your heart

Here and Now
Is the way I live
Unafraid of what life gives
Respect things I don't understand

(Here and now)
So many intentions
In this life I could have followed
But one of those paths must lead to your heart

Here and Now
(Here and Now)
Here and Now


Chocolate's all i wanted
Sugar's all i needed
So tell me what to buy now
Cause i ate your snack

The word were hard to convey
But the food just taste that way
A lesson i've learned too well for sure
So don't get mad at me now
I'll buy more food , i do promise
I'm going cracy without food

Chocolate's all i wanted
Sugar's all i needed
So tell me what to buy now
Cause i ate your snack

Just the other day
I had to raid the refrigerator
There wasn't any food to eat
I told you not to worry
And i'f buy more food today
I didn't know then that you were mad

Chocolate's all i wanted
Sugar's all i needed yeah
You're pretty pissed off now
Cause i ate your snack

Chorus to fade


I never believed in dreaming
It never got me very far
I never believed that love could find me
Like an arrow through the heart
I never believed in miracles
Or building castles in the air
Not until that day I found you
I turned around and you were there

From the day you came you gave me
A whole new point of view
I've been touched by an angel
It's impossible but true

(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always

I never believed in fairytales
Though sometimes I wish I could
I never believed that golden slippers
Could ever find the perfect foot
I never believed in magic
Or that wishes could come true
But your very first kiss
Changed all this something only you could do

You made me a believer
You made me trust again
You showed me there's a pot of gold
At every rainbow's end

(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always

Only love could set you free
And if you serve to fate
Then you're my destiny
Now I know
Now I see
Anything can happen
If you just believe

(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always


This is the time of year, that we learn to give
And the greatest gift is learning to forgive.
We will have the best that time we ever knew
If you forgive me and I forgive you

I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

It's so hard to believe
We're staring at the end
When all we think about is starting up again
Whatever we lost, when we were apart
We'll find it all alone in the dark

I don't wanna light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

There's nothing more that I want from you
Then to lie here together
And stay here forever with you
There's no one I ever knew
That I wanted to spend Christmas with, more than you....

I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

I don't want to light a fire
Unless it will warm your heart
I'm playin no holiday songs
I need you to sing your part
And baby if I could have just one wish come true
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas
I don't wanna spend one more Christmas without you

I Will 

When life seems hopeless
And you're all alone (all alone)
And no-one's there to dry
The teardrops from your eyes
When you can't find a single reason left to try
Baby I will (baby I will)
Baby I will 

Tell me the secrets
That you've locked away (locked away)
Confide your deepest fears
That haunt you every day
All of the little things
Nobody else could understand
Baby I will (baby I will)
I will 

It's alright
I'll be there
Count on me
Anytime, anywhere
I'll show you love
'Till the end of my life
When no-one else will stand by your side
I will 

When all you've counted on
Comes tumbling down (tumbling down, tumbling down)
And there's only emptyness
That nothing seems to fill
And when you can't remember
How to be strong
Baby I will (baby I will)
I will 

It's alright
I'll be there
Count on me
Anytime, anywhere
I'll show you love
'Till the end of my life
When no-one else will stand by your side
I will 

When no-one else will stand by your side
I will 

It's alright
I'll be there
Count on me
Anytime, anywhere (anytime, anywhere)
I'll show you love (I'll show you love)
'Till the end of my life
When no-one else will stand by your side 

I'll be standing right by your side
I will


Baby, trust me
I know you're shy
But when you're with me
I see the love in your eyes
Tell me why can't you see the way it feels
And if our love is real
Say you'll love me
Forever and ever

Chorus:
Cause i'll be back for more
Lady, i'll be back for more
Why can't you say
That you feel the same way
Lady, i'll be back for more

You say, you're afraid you'll get burned again
But baby, i pray that someday
You'll let my love in
I can't wait
Tell me how you really feel
And say our love is real
Say you'll love me forever and ever

Chorus:
I'll be back for more
Baby, i'll be back for more
Why can't you say
You feel the same way
Baby, i'll be back for more

Oh baby, Just let me know (Just let me know)
Girl, if you love me
You've got to let it show (Just let it show)
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please

I'll be back for more
I'll be back for more
Why can't you say
You feel the same way
Lady, i'll be back for more

And i will be back for more...


I never thought you were a fair weather friend
You never let me down, you're true to the end
You're in the darkest hour, when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me, for you and you should know

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
I say it ain't worth losing you
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
Someday you'll see if only through heaven's eyes

I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive I could never forget
'Cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
You told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth and you should know

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
I say it ain't worth losing you
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
Someday you'll see if only through heaven's eyes

Only through heaven's eyes

And so we can't forget
We've got to keep remembering them all the ones who took the fall
They did it for us all and we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it, you've got to face the world be strong

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
I say it ain't worth losing you
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
Someday you'll see if only through heaven's eyes

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through
I say it ain't worth losing you
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
Someday you'll see if only through heaven's eyes


Ohh, it's Christmas
Ohh, ahh, ooh, I'm so glad that you came my way
From a million stars here you are
I swear your love is mine

And somehow I knew that you were made for me
And I can't believe that my wish came true
I'll never let you go, baby
People are celebrating all throughout the world

And that's what we're gonna do tonight
'Cause we've got so much, so much love to share
Ooh, it's Christmas and we'll share a love
Just like we did last year
Ohh, ohh it's Christmas
And you know I'm gonna be right here

And still my heart belongs to you and only you
Merry Christmas, darlin'
Let us share the joy of love tonight
Cold winter nights may come and go

But we're still dancing slow
Can't you hear my song
The song I sing for you
(Yes, I sing for you)
People are celebrating all throughout the world

And that's what we're gonna do tonight
'Cause we've got so much, so much love to share
Ohh it's Christmas and we'll share a love
Just like we did last year
Ohh ohh it's Christmas
And you know I'm gonna be right here

Well, I'm gonna be right here
(I'm gonna be right there for you ohh)
I'm not gonna wait no more, no more
People are celebrating all throughout the world

And that's what we're gonna do tonight
'Cause we've got so much, so much love to share
Ooh, it's Christmas
And we'll share a love just like we did last year
Ohh, ohh it's Christmas
And you know I'm gonna be right here

And I wish you such a nice Christmas
And Merry Christmas to all
And Merry Christmas to the world


{{Instrumental}}


Oh
Ohhh
Ohhh
I'm gonna tell you now, oh, oh
When I had you to myself I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch one glance is all it took
And now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please let me 
Back in your heart 
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go 
Let you go, baby 
And now when I've seen you it is on 
I want you back 
Yes I know now 
I want you back 
Ooh ooh baby  

A B C 
It's easy as 
1 2 3 
As simple as 
Do re mi
A B C
That's how easy love can be 
Chris You went to school to learn girl
Never ever knew before 
Like 'I' before 'E' except after 'C' 
Why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now
I'm gonna teach you 
Teach you, teach you 
All about love girl 
All about love 
Sit yourself down and take a seat
Cuz all you gotta do is repeat after me 
A B C 
It's easy as 
1 2 3 
As simple as 
Do re mi
A B C
That's how easy love can be
Do do do do do do...  

Stop!
You'd better sing it
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better sing it 
We played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It
Chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit
Now and back in grade school
I promised you a ring
Just like back in grade school
You're doing the same old thing
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone 

You'd better stop the love you save may be your own 
Darling, look both ways before you cross me 
Headed for the danger zone 
All Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
S is for Save it
T is forTake it slow
O is for Oh, no
P is for Please, please, don't go 
The love you save may be your own 
Some day you may be all alone 
All Hold on
Hold on
Stop

And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings are hung by the fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive

With the love in the room 
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here
And with the blessings from above

It's Christmas time and all the kids will see
The gifts under the tree 
It's the best time of year
For the family

CHORUS

Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays

No matter what your holiday
It's a time to celebrate
Put your worries aside
And open up your mind 
See the world right by your side

CHORUS


I just want you to know 
You to know
Hold me I really want to tell you 
I'm sorry
I could never let you go 

And after all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise you
And after all that we've said and done
You're a part of me
Can't let go
I can't let go


Now we're here
J-U-S-T-I-N(what what)
We are here for you
What's that you say
Baby its okay
Cuz u know we're ugly

CHORUS
BSB kicks our ass
Because they always do
Baby i know we're lucky
But look on the bright side
We are loaded
And can buy you things

So ignore our strange looks
And when you kiss us
You can picture B-rok if you want
But please baby
Hold my hand
Cuz britney wont touch me


Ooh...
Ah...

Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

Ah...
Ooh...

Long lay the world
(Long lay the world)
In sin and error pining
'Til he appeared
And the soul felt it's worth

Ah..

The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Oh fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born

Oh holy night
Oh night divine
Oh holy night
Oh night divine

The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born

Oh night divine
Oh night divine
(Oh Holy night)
Oh holy night
(Oh holy night)
Oh night Divine
(Oh holy night, oh holy night, oh)
When Christ was born
Holy night when Christ was born


I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more

Another dead-end street, another love gone wrong
Another shattered dream, always the same old song
I started thinking that, you'll never come along

I got all this love inside, that so long was denied
I wish you knew what I've been through to get to you

I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you

After everything my heart's been through
I treasure every moment I spend with you
For me to feel this way is something new

Now it's got ahold of me, it's making me believe
That what we've got is something unlike any other

I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you

* If you're thinking what I'm thinking
* All you gotta do is say the word (say the word)
* If you tell me what you're needing
* I can give you what you're asking for (asking for)

Well I didn't have a prayer, I thought nobody cared
Turned around and you were there

I have been waiting for you (waiting for you baby)
And I want you to know (I want you to know)

On the line to show you
That I'll never let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do (nothing that I wouldn't
Do)

I'm layin' it
On the line to show you
Never gonna let you go, never gonna let you go
On the line for your love
There's nothing I want more
When you smile, I feel my heart open
And I know there's nothing that I would not do
I'm layin' it
On the line this time
Just to be with you


{{Instrumental}}


I was making my list
I was checking it twice
In the middle of this
I got tears in my eyes
For in my foolish heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you

I was trimming the tree
I was stringing the lights
While the radio played Silent Night
There were presents you sent
Though there were quite a few
The only gift I wanted was you

You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

As the bittersweet night
Had come to an end
(An end)
I was saying goodbye
(Bye, bye, bye)
To my family and friends
And they all wished me well
And I knew that I knew
The only gift I wanted was you

And you need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you 

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la la la la la la
Ooh Ooh
The only gift I wanted was you

You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

I was making my list
I was checking it twice
In the middle of this
I got tears in my eyes
For in my wishful heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you

For in my wishful heart
There was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you


I get a feeling
I can't explain
Whenever your eyes meet mine
My heart spins in circles
And I lose all space and time
And now that we're standing face to face
Somethin' tells me
It's gonna be okay

And I'm ready to fall in love tonight
Ready to hold my heart open wide
Can't promise forever but baby I'll try
I'm ready to fall in love tonight

I know you've been watching
Choosin' your moment
BUT I've been dreaming of that day
No one before you has gotten to me this way
And now that we're standing face to face
There's something that I need to say

And I'm ready to fall in love tonight
Ready to hold my heart open wide
Can't promise forever but baby I'll try
Cause I'm ready to fall in love tonight

Nothing is certain, this I know
Wherever we're headed I'm ready to go
I can't promise forever but baby I'll try
Cause I'm ready to fall in love tonight
Cause I'm ready to fall in love tonight
Cause I'm ready to fall in love tonight
In love tonight


Here it comes, millennia
And everybody's talkin' about Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end?
Well, I've got other thoughts, my friends

See I've got my eyes on the skies
The heavenly bodies of light
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
Then strap on the suit and get inside

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo
Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo

We don't need all these prophecies
Telling us what's inside
'Cuz paranoia ain't the way
To live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and your fears behind

Don't be afraid at all
'Cuz up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and your body to the test
'Cuz up in outer space is like a 'Wild Wild West'

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo
Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay
Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo

Sonic boom and never let you try to stop me
You wanna fly sky high up to the top see
No need to fear, no doubts and no tears
Millennium sound will motivate the future years

And you've been hit to be scared
Or get prepared against all odds
I'll bet you never would've dared
To make these moves and take flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy

Space connect to overthrow your interception
Ready or not, make it hot, there ain't no question
Or get in sync and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith one love from Left Eye

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly, come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

Wi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yay

Riprock,AG
Come in, over
Yo, turn me up
I wanna be heard
See I'm talkin' about the future ya'll
And the future looks bright
'specially when we rip it in half

Here it comes (Millennium)
And everybody's talkin 'bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end
Well, I've got other thoughts my friend

See I've got my eyes on the skies
The heavenly bodies up high
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
Then strap on a suit and get inside

Whi-yi-yi-yippie-yi-yay-yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yo

We don't need all these prophecies
Tellin' us what's a sign, what's a sign
'Cause paranoia ain't the way to live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and fears behind

Don't be afraid at all
'Cause up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and body to the test
'Cause up in outer space it's like the wild wild west

Chorus-repeat

Boom and never let you try and stop me
Born to fly sky high, up to the top see
Nothing to fear, no doubts and no tears
Millennium sound to motivate the future years
And you can either be scared or get prepared
Against all odds I bet you never would've dared
To make these moves and take a flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy
Space connect to overthrow your interception,
Ready or not, make it hot
That ain't no question
Get *NSYNC and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith
One love from Left Eye  (Left Eye)

Chorus-repeat

Riprock, Ag end of transmission
They've had enough


Why dont you drive to my heart
Can i take your order?
Look what you get for just one more quarter

Wanna super size it
Hold the pickle
And do it up big
When it comes to my love
I'll be a hungry pig (snort snort)

C'mon and super size it
Hold the pickle

I'm down on my knees
If you dont want all my love
Next window please
(Next window please)

Super size it!


Justin Hey, hey

*NSYNC  When 
JC  You weren't there for me 
*NSYNC  So 
JC  Now it's time to leave and make it alone 
Justin  I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door 
*NSYNC  Bye Bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two 
Justin  You may hate me but it ain't no lie 
*NSYNC  Baby, Bye Bye Bye
Don't really want to make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough 
JC  Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Bye Bye Bye
Bye Bye 
Aerosmith  I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you are far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where a moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
Cuz I miss you baby
And I don't want to miss a thing, Cuz even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing 
Justin  You might've been hurt babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in no man, no cry
Maybe that's why 
*NSYNC  Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me 
Justin  Ooh, yeah yeah
There comes a day when I'll be the one
You'll see 
*NSYNC  It's 
Joey & Lance  Gonna 
Justin  Gonna 
JC  Gonna 
Chris  Gonna  
Aerosmith  It's gonna be me
Hey, J-j-jaded
You got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're gettin' it all over me
X rated
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm talking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I been thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you'r so jaded
Jaded
Jaded
Yeah you're so jaded 
Aerosmith & *NSYNC  I'm the one that jaded you 
Aerosmith  Backseat lover always hiding underneath the cover
Still I talked to your daddy he say
He said you ain't seen nothing
Till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be changing your ways
I met a cheerleader who was a real young pleaser
All the times I can reminisce
Cuz the best thing about it
With her sister and her cousin
It started with a little kiss
Like this 
Britney Spears  See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
Your feet flying up in the air 
Aerosmith  Singing hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you didn't care 
Aerosmith & Britney Spears  So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play 
Aerosmith  Was it me she was foolin'
Cuz she knew what she was doin'
Told me how to walk this way
I told her to 
All  Walk This Way
Talk This Way
Walk This Way
Talk This Way 
Aerosmith  Just give me a 
Britney Spears  School girl Sadie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knees 
Justin  There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me 
Chris  I was a high school loser
Never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed 
Justin  Whoa
Then my next door neighbour
With a daughter had a favour
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this 
All  Walk This Way
She told me to Talk This Way
She told me to Walk This Way
Talk This Way
She told me to Walk This Way
Talk This Way
She told me to Walk This Way
Talk This Way 
Nelly  I'm a sucka for corn rows and manicured toes
Fendi capri pants and Parasucco's
I see 'em in the city with one or two throws 
I'm droppin 'em outta high school straight into the pros 
Who knows? I know! 
And I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows 
And break it down low to the flo', and there you go
Now throw it on me slow 
And everytime I bust a rhyme baby, gimme some mo'
Come on 
All  Walk This Way
Talk This Way
She told me to Walk This Way
Talk This Way
She told me to Walk This Way
Talk This Way
She said Walk This Way
Talk This Way 
Aerosmith  Just push play

Can we back it up just a lil bit?

I said bye!
I said bye!
Why?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!

Oh oh! Yeah!

We were born the same day
We even think the same way
It couldn't be more right
We are what they call a perfect match
Somethin that ya can't touch
Down to the last bone your my baby!
But to be honest there's just one thing...
A part that is missing
You don't seem to care at all!

Chorus:
Tell me, tell me baby!
How come you don't wanna love me?
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you?
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I supposed to do right now?
Why can't ya love me?
Why...tell me my baby!

Now from the moment we met
I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong?
Now I'm hearing that your seeing someone new
And I wanna know who
But does he love you like I do my baby
But I promise you this one thing:
Whatever that's missing
I will make it up to you
(So tell me baby now!)

Chorus:
Tell me, tell me baby!
How come you don't wanna love me?
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you?
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I supposed to do right now?
Why can't ya love me?
Why...tell me my baby!

For getting under my skin
For messin up my mind
For never lettin me in
To your life and...
Tell me baby how come you don't wanna love me and am I supposed to live without?
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too!
(It's you I want)

Tell me, tell me!
Tell me, tell me!
We were born the same day
We even think the same way
We are what they all call a perfect match
Tell me baby!

Chorus:
How come you don't wanna love me? (How come you don't wanna)
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you? (Without you)
Tell me, tell me just how (Tell me how)
What am I supposed to do right now?

Why...tell me my baby!

Chorus:

Every day just doin' that thing

'''JC:'''
I don't know when we fell apart
The love that we had was like a work of art
I used to see Heaven in your eyes
The angels are falling from your skies
Things we said were so wrong 
And I haven't held you for so long
My foolish pride turns me inside
Why did we tell all those lies?
You can reach, for the phone
You don't have to be alone

Outside the winter seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow
And there's no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you've cried
You fell asleep by the fireside
But there's one thing you should know
On this Christmas baby
You don't have to be alone…

'''Justin:'''
And I had only one wish on my list, oh
For me you would be the perfect gift, oh yeah
There's nothing colder than an empty home, oh no (empty home)
And holidays were never meant to be alone, oh (to be alone)
The smiles we gave when our hearts were safe
By each other's love and warmth
That's subsided now with happiness around
If I can only find the way to your heart…

Outside the winter seems so cold (so cold, so cold)
Your heart is frozen like the snow (frozen like the snow, oh so cold)
And there's no one home to keep you safe and warm (no one home, keep you safe 
And warm yeah)
Your eyes are red because you've cried (you've cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (by the fireside)
But there's one thing you should know (one thing you should know)
On this Christmas baby
You don't have to be alone…yeah, uh

You don't (no, no) have to be alone
You don't have to be (no, no) all alone at home
Ohhhh… on Christmas…
You don't (you don't) have to be alone…
You don't have to be…(alone) alone 
You don't have to be alone

Outside the winter seems so cold (so cold, sing it baby)
Your heart is frozen like the snow (frozen like the snow yeah… like a snow)
And there's no one home (no one home) to keep you safe and warm (to keep you 
Safe and warm)
You don't have to be alone
Your eyes are red because you've cried (you've cried)
You fell asleep by the fireside (by the fireside)
But there's one thing you should know (one thing you should know)
On this Christmas baby, you don't have to be…. Alone…. Yeah…


Stop it! Stop it, Girl! 
Stop it! Stop it, Girl! 

I said stop it, girl. Look what you're doing to me 
It's just not right. Can't you see? 
This ain't the way it's supposed to be, 
I should be lovin' you and you lovin' me 

[mechanical voice] Stop Girl, before he breaks your heart 

Stop girl, before he breaks your heart 
I'm the one who loves you, right from the start 
Stop girl, don't let him bring you down 
I'm the one who loves you and I'll be around 

He could never love you like I love you, girl 
He could never say the things, like I need you in my world 
Girl, I really love you, but you won't give me your time 
You tell me that he loves you so and you can't make up your mind 

Girl, he's not true 
Now I know there's lovin' for you 
It's all not true 
It's not true, baby 
OOOOOOOH 

[Chorus]

I guess I'm gonna love you for my whole life long 
Girl, he's not the one for you, I can tell you nothing wrong 
Tell me that you love me, let me take you by the hand 
Girl, my love is oh so true, try and understand 

Girl, it's so true 
All of my lovin' for you 
It's all so true 
So true, Baby 
OOOOOOOH 

Stop it, Girl! 
Stop it, Girl 
[Electric guitar bridge]

Stop Girl, before he breaks your heart 
(Don't let him break your heart) 
I'm the one that loves you, right from the start 
(Right from the start) 
Stop Girl, don't let him bring you down 
(don't let him bring you down) 
I'm the one that needs you and I'll be around 
(I'll be around) 
Stop it Girl, before he breaks your heart 
(Oh Baby) 

Don't let him 
Don't let him 
Don't let him 
Bring you down 

[repeat chorus to fade out]


I gave my heart and soul to you, girl 
(Now didn't I do it, baby, didn't I do it, baby?) 
Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh 
(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?) 
I've cried so many times and that's no lie 
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry 

Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I 
Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I, this time? 

I thought that heart of yours was true, girl 
(Now, didn't I think it, baby, didn't I think it, baby?) 
But this time I'm really leaving you girl, oh 
(Hope you know it, baby, hope you know it, baby) 

Ten times or more, yes, I walked out that door 
Get this into your head, there'll be no more 

Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I 
Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I, this time? 

(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?) 
(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?) 

Ten times or more, yes, I walked out that door 
Get this into your head, there'll be no more 

Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I 
Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I, this time? 

Girl, can we talk for a second? 
(Baby can we talk) 
I know it's been a long time 
Since someone blew your mind, like I did 
(Ooh, baby) 
But there'll be other times 
(Didn't I blow your mind it happens all the time) 
For me and you 
(All the time)(Ooh, baby) 
And I can see the tears fallin' from your eyes 
(I can see the tears falling from your eyes) 
Tell me girl did I blow your mind? 

Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I 
Didn't I blow your mind this time 
Didn't I, this time? 


[Chorus]
You're my pop-si-cle! 
From the very first time I met you, Girl, you captured me 
You're my pop-si-cle! 
All I know is that you make me feel so fancyfree. 

Gonna love you for a lifetime 
And I know you're gonna love me too 
You make me feel, feel so real 
And it feels so good, through and through 

Sweeter than candy 
Better than cake 
And everytime we kiss 
It feels oh so great 

Girl, can't you see? 
You're the one, you're the one for me! 

[Chorus]

When I call you up on my favorite party line 
You sound so sweet, Girl. You're blowing my mind 
Our love is much better than any other I know 
And it keeps on growing, more and more 

Girl, can't you see? 
You're the one, you're the one for me! 

[Chorus]

POP POP POP POP POP POPSICLE! 

Hey, hey, little girl with your pretty dress on 
I've been wanting you to want me for my whole life long 
You knock me off my feet, girl, you're a super treat 
When I see you in the street you make my heart skip a beat 

You're the one who makes me feel alright 
When I look into your eyes, you know you're really out of sight 
I'm for you and you're for me 
We could stay together so easily 

POP POP POP POP POP POPSICLE! 

Girl, can't you see? 
You're the one, you're the one for me! 

[Chorus ]

POP POP POP POP POP POPSICLE!

We know you've heard this beat many, many times
But we bet you've never heard it with such a vicious rhyme
A rhyme with class and plenty of clout
To show you sucher M.C.'s what it's about
We hear the same stories everywhere we go
Hey, it's Nynuk who stole the show
So for all you party people who are in a state of shock
We're The New Kids On The Block!

Chillin' on the corner, the first day we arrived
From the looks of the hoods, we didn't think we'd survive
Second day we were there, we were walking down the street
With a rhyme in mind and a funky beat

But when we turned into the alley, to our surprise
We saw a bunch of hoods right before our eyes
They looked us up and down once, twice and again
There must have been a hundred to a hundred and ten
So, I looked over my shoulder right at my friend
He said 'Nice knowing you' but this is the end

So we battened down the hatches and prepared to fight
Then all of a sudden I seen the light
The time was right, the time to rock
'Cause everybody knows, we're The New Kids On The Block.

We're also devistating when we're on stage
The fans start screaming and yelling with rage
With mic's in hand and rhymes with clout
So watch it sucker MCs or we're gonna turn you out

We never talk trash, our rhymes are clean
Our rhymes are never vague and we say nothing obscene
So any sucker MCs who wanna battle us
Can you go at least 20 lines without a cuss?
Cause once we start to jam, you'll be in a state of shock
Clear the way party people, we're The New Kids On The Block

Move it sucker MCs or you're gonna feel the wrath
So don't get caught up in the aftermath
Cause we're the funky MCs of the hip hop craze
Our rhymes are done by law and are sure to amaze

With a DJ cutting records, steady cross bass
We'll leave all you party people stuck in a daze
I say we're fresh, new and you know it's true
Now let me introduce you to the rest of the crew

J, he's fresh. He's the master of mix
There ain't no rhyme that he can't fix
Spinster's next, he's the king of the spin
And if you wanna battle, you ain't gonna win

Then there's Popeye, but we call him Joey
The kid's so fresh, you'll never be bored
Next is jon, whose word is true
But the party people know him as the runner GQ

I'm Dexter P. the wizard of word
I'm the greatest MC that you've ever heard
Now that you know we're a gang and you know we don't play
We're The New Kids On The Block and we're here to stay

aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhROCK!!!


Danny: Yo, Jordan! What's up? 
Jordan: Hey Danny! What's happening? 
Oh, here comes little Joey Joe down the street 
Joe: Ho! What's happenin' fellas? 
Jordan: Yo, there's Jon, but has anyone seen Donnie? 
Danny: I don't know, but I thought I saw him walking towards the corner store. 
Joe: Nah, he's at the park playing ball 
Jon: Oh, here he comes now 
(ad libbed greetings) 
Donnie: Hey Guys! 
Danny: Where have you been? 
Donnie: Man, I've got a story to tell! 
All: HIT IT! 

Donnie: 
Saw a homegirl at the corner store 
Eyes started bugging, mouth fell to the floor 
She had a miniskirt and a sexy pose 
I tried to rap to her, but I just froze 
Tell me now fellas, what can I do? 
To make a girl like me, like a girl likes you? 

Danny:Well Homeboy get ready! 
Joe: 'Cause you want correcting 
Jordan: 'Cause a girl needs love 
All: And plenty of affection 

Jon: If a girl were mine, I'd give her the world 
I'd buy her diamonds and pearls just to make her my girl 

Jordan: That might work with your girl, but not with mine. 
She's not the type of girl to fall for any line 

Joe: I'd take her out to dinner, treat her like a winner 
I may be young, but I'm no beginner 

Danny: All your ways are good, but not as good as mine 
You have to be sincere for a girl that fine! 

Chorus 
Baby, won't you please be mine? 
Are you down? 
Baby, won't you please be mine? 
Are you down? HO! 

Danny: Alright then, D., since you gave it a try 
All: Tell us about the girl who caught your eye 

Donnie: 
It was after school and I was feeling cool 
'Til I saw that girl and I started to drool 
So I thought to myself, take it easily 
I couldn't let peer pressure get the best of me 
I thought to myself, what should I do? 
That's when she came up on me and said 'I love you' 

Donnie: Who me? 
All: Yeah, you! 
Donnie: Couldn't be! 
All: But it's true! 

Donnie: So I rushed back home to tell you guys, 
But not before I got a quick kiss goodbye! 

All: Did you meet her friends? 
Donnie: Yeah, they looked def. 
All: Yo, that was fresh! 
Donnie: Word! Let's go left. 
Jordan: So here goes the keys 
Joe: On which it depends 
Jordan: She's got 
Joe: One! 
Jordan: Two! 
Danny: Three! 
Jon: Four! 
All: Fresh girlfriends!

Are you down?

Chorus 

Are you down? 
Are you down?

All: Joey Joe! 
Joe: Nimble and quick. 
You have to be def to be down with my clique 

All: Jon! 
Jon:You know I've got the style 
When I go into a party all the girls go wild 

All: Danny D! 
Danny: The prince! Make no mistake. 
I'm the MC devistating. So cool and I break.(dance) 

All: Don-nie! Donnie: That's me, don't give me no slack!

See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on

See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

Love the way you turn me on

Some days are gone
But my love lives on
In this space and time
I remember
Playing the games
Funny nicknames
And all the sunny days
That shine so brightly

I keep remembering when
We started together as friends
I keep remembering when
We were together forever
The promise we made
Still stays in my head
Like the melody
I remember
Favorite songs
We heard all night long
In the candlelight
Still shines so brightly

I keep remembering when
We started together as friends
I keep remembering when
We were together forever

I bet you didn't know
How much I loved you
I bet you didn't know
Just how much I care
Little girl
Whenever I'm around you
All in love is fair, girl

I keep remembering when
We started together as friends
I keep remembering when
We were together forever

I wanted a girl like you
I've looked so long

Girl, nothing will make us stop
I know our love is too strong
Let's leave the rest behind
Our dreams ask what we will find

My favorite girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Hold on, girl, ooh, girl, hold on
Girl, let's rock around the clock, we can dance and never stop
Come on, girl, just hold on tight, I know you wanna rock tonight
Through the night into the day we could chase our blues away
So grab a hold, don't lose control, I really know you got the soul
Hold on, girl, hold on, ooh, girl, hold on

Hold on, girl, hold on, ooh, girl, hold on
Girl, the feeling's in the air, don't you know, it's everywhere
Everywhere around the block, people dance until they just can't stop
Through the night...

Hold on, girl, hold on, ooh, girl, hold on [repeat & fade]




This a very serious message, so all of you...please listen.

There are some people living in this world,
They have no food to eat,
They have no place to go.

But we all are God's children,
We have to learn to love one another,
Just remember they could be us,
Remember we all are brothers.

I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
Show them there's a better way.

This one's for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

Many people are happy,
And many people are sad.
Some people have many things,
That others can only wish they had.

So for the sake of the children,
Show them love's the only way to go,
'Cause they're our tomorrow,
And people they've got to know.

I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
And show them there's a better way.

This ones for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

This one's, for the children
Only for the children
The children of the world
This one's, for the children
This one's, for the children

Many people are happy,
Many people are sad,
This one's for the children of the world
The children of the world.



I hope everybody's havin' a merry Christmas, I know I am, hey! 
I feel good, I feel all right, hey!

Last night, I couldn't believe my eyes, y'all
I saw a big fat man in a red disguise, y'all
He had a fuzzy white beard and big black boots
He had a pack on his back and red caboose, now... check this out
I tried to sleep, but my eyes wouldn't shut
You wouldn't believe it Mama, guess what!

Last night I saw Santa Claus
Sneakin' out of my back door
Last night I saw Santa Claus
What's he got in his great big bag for me?
What's he got for me?

He had crazy long hair and a red guitar, y'all
I never knew Santa Claus was a rock and roll star, now
Look-a-here...hey!
I asked my Mama could I join his band
She just screamed and yelled...she don't understand

Last night I saw Santa Claus
Sneakin' out of my back door
Last night I saw Santa Claus
What's he got in his great big bag for me?
What's he got for me?
I wonder what he's got for me 

Hey, Jon, what's Santa doin'?
He's pullin' somethin' out of his bag... what is it?
Uh, it looks like... a saxophone!
Hey, Santa!

Look-a-here
I tried to sleep, but my eyes wouldn't shut
I told all my friends... guess what!

Last night I saw Santa Claus
Sneakin' out of my back door
Last night I saw Santa Claus
What's he got in his great big bag for me?
What's he got for me?
I wonder what he's got for me 

Blow, Santa!
Can't even sleep at night
Talkin' 'bout Santa Claus
Hey, ooh!
Play it one more time
Hey!
Sounds so good
Hey fellas, let's jam!



Did you ever really start to cry over something you just wrote?
Well I'm writing you, my dear st. nick, it's the saddest little note.
Is it fair come this christmas eve that I should be alone,
When she knows how much I'm missing her, would you kindly bring her home?

This boy's letter to santa claus it's gonna tear him up,
When he reads how much I'm missing her it's gonna tear him up.
I'm sure if all his reindeers could arrange room on his sleigh
Then I'd receive a big bright package and she'd be mine today.

I'll be missing you come christmas, wishing hard, my dear,
Missing you come christmas, wishing you were here.

Did you ever really start to cry over something that was said?
Well, I'm writing you, dear santa, it's the saddest thing you ever read.
Is it fair come this christmas time that I should be without you,


You know how much I miss you, girl, won't you kindly help me through?

This boy's letter to santa claus it's gonna tear him up,
When he reads how much I'm missing her it's gonna tear him up.
I'm sure he'll write a special note to remind him christmas eve
That he has to mend a broken heart that believes in make believe.

Right above his vip we'll be ranking number one,
No sadder request will he receive he'll know it has to be done.

Hey, santa, if you're my friend, please take heed, it's not pretend.
This boy's letter....
I'm sure if all ....

Oh, santa, I'll be missing you come christmas, wishing hard, my dear,
Missing you come christmas, wishing you were here.



I still believe in Santa Claus
Maybe that's just because I'm still a child at heart
And I still believe in old St. Nick
But then again, maybe that's the trick we need
We need to retreat to a world of make-believe

Let's make this Christmas last forever
Shine a little love along the way 
For the sake of all children
Let love show us the way

I still...

This time of year is for the giving
This time of year is for the joy
May joy and happiness be with you always this day
I still...




Peace to the world from the New Kids On The Block, we are here
We're spreading all our joy, spreading all our love and our cheers
Cheerful sleigh bells ring, choir children sing
It's peace and love and harmony we bring

Hail, merry Christmas, merry, merry Christmas
To all our sisters and brothers
Hail, merry Christmas, merry, merry Christmas
Let all of the world join our hands

There's a feeling in the air, it's beginning to look like Christmas everywhere
Hear the gentle sounds of the snowflakes trickle down without a care
People stop and stare, the Christmas tree is there
A star on top which nothing can't compare

Hail, merry Christmas, merry, merry Christmas
It's all about peace and understanding
Hail, merry Christmas, merry, merry Christmas
Let all of the world lend a hand

A time for me, a time for you
There's enough of love to last our whole life through
Hail, merry...




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe 
Help to make the season birght 
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way 
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple thase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Sneaking downstairs on christmas eve

St. nick by the fireplace dusting off his head with a frown on his face

He said you left the fire burning and I burnt my butt
So now I've learned you've got to turn the fireplace down
So santa won't get burned

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white




Come, they told me, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
the newborn King you'll see, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom. 
Our finest gifts we bring, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
to lay before the King, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
so to honor him, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, when we come. 

Little baby, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
I am a poor boy too, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
I have no gift to bring, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
that fit to give our King, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, 
so to honor him, pa-romp-pa-pom-pom, I'll play my drum.

And how I'd be loving you forever...
Taught you 'bout hanging tough
As long as you've got the right stuff

Didn't we, girls? Ooh ooh
Didn't we, girls? Aah, aah

Well I guess it's a brand new day after all
Every time we hear the curtain call
See the girls with the curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares

Tonight, tonight

Remember when we traveled 'round the world
We met a lot of people and girls...
Fan mail from everywhere
Showed us how you care

Didn't it, girls? Ooh, ooh
Didn't it, girls? Aah, aah

Well, I guess it's a brand new day after all
Every time we hear the curtain call

I've heard of true loves that lasted forever, I guess there is a way, 
and I've heard of true loves that needed each other more and more each day. 
What is love when there's no one that cares? 
Next time you need my love I'll be there, be right by your side. 
Let's try it again, try it again, let's try it again, 
my love for you, it has no end. 
Let's try it again, 'till the end, all because I love you. 

I've heard of two loves that stayed with each other, 
didn't wander through the night, 
and I've heard of two loves that prayed for each other, 
didn't argue, fuss or fight. 
Now I know just what love's all about. 
Next time you need my love I won't doubt, doubt your love again. 
Let's try.... [repeat & fade]

No more games is about positivity
And positivity is not about being soft
It's about being smart
You sucker

Ain't it funky

Yeah, we're gonna send this one out 
To all those non-believers out there
Who been tryin' to put us down and keep us down
For the past five years
I'm gon' tell you what
We ain't goin' out like that
You think this is a love song
Wrong
The NKOTB is too strong

Games, games, games, games, games

Somebody said somebody
Wouldn't last too long
Somebody keep going strong
Somebody said somebody was all a front
Somebody still talking junk

Think of what you say
Think of what you do
Think of what you're trying to put us through
We're just singing a song

When you put us down
It ain't gonna get you nowhere
We're positive
And no matter what you think, we really care

Games

Games, games, games, games, games

Somebody said somebody worked too hard
Somebody gotta charm some hearts
Somebody said everybody's gonna wait and see
What's gonna be is gonna be
We don't need your games

Think of what you say
Think of what you do
Think of what you're trying to put us through
We're just singing a song

When you put us down
It ain't gonna get you nowhere
We're positive
And no matter what you think, we really care

Games
Ain't it funky
Games, games, games, games, games
Games
Games, games, games, games, games
Games

No more games, boy
So what ya saying
Beat the beatness
'Cause Donnie ain't playin'

Witness the quickness as I kick this
I'm on a mission, so listen
As I dismiss all this negativity by takin' a stand
'Cause we're five bad brothers from the bean town land

No sell out
So get the hell out
We do it our way
Who gives a damn about what critics say

Said we wouldn't last
Said our time will pass
In just a flash
But we're still kicking ass

The Donnie
The Wahl to the Berg
That's funky
And now the games must cease

And to the non-believers, I say peace
Stop playin' those games
Boy
Huh-huh
Ahh, yeah
Uh huh, uh huh
Yeah
Whoah

Ain't it funky
We don't need your games
Uh-huh

Whoah
Stop playin' those games

The Gold Brothers
The Milkbar Mobb
And this record right here
Was made to show and prove
That positivity is not about being soft
It's about being smart
You sucker!
Peace




Girl, there's more to love 
Than meets the eye
There's more to what I feel inside
And if I told you, would you be my girl
For you, I'd travel 'round the world

Time is on our side, girl, you're my one true love, girl
We've come too far to ever be just friends
Time is on our side, girl, let's show the whole world
Love is the answer and time is our closest friend

If I sent you flowers, would you walk away
Or would it be enough to make you stay?
Even though we're young, girl, one thing's for sure
With time, our love will endure

Time is on our side, girl, you're my one true love, girl
We've come too far to ever be just friends
Time is on our side, girl, let's show the whole world
Love is the answer and time is our closest friend

Time brings us closer every day

Time is on our side, girl
You're my one true love, girl

Love is the answer and time is our closest friend




Where do I go from here?
Do I tell you I still love you?
And where do I go from there?
Do I tell you I still miss you?
Can't you see' you're a part of me?
Don't you know' I can't let you go?

My problems are few when I'm with you
what should I do?
I don't know, I don't know

Where do I go from here?
Do I tell you I still love you?
And where do I go from there?
Do I tell you I still miss you?
Picture me not loving you
Picture you, what you're going through

My problems are few when I'm with you
What should I do?
I don't know, I don't know

Where do I go from here?
Do I tell you I still love you?
And where do I go from there?
Do I tell you I still miss you?

Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?

[Spoken:] Yeah, man, oh, we're going to have some fun with this one, man, 
And I don't know where it's gonna take us, 
But it's a long way from Boston, man, here we go. 

Stay with me baby, stay with me baby, me whole life long. 
Stay with me baby, stay with me baby, I can do you no wrong. 

Sure me saw you walking down the street, 
You were looking so good, I said you were looking so sweet, 
Then me didn't know what to say, all I know is that you're 
Brightening up a beautiful day, ah. 

[Spoken:] Oh, yeah, wer're groovin' now, man, oh, yeah! 

Nobody can tell me my baby's not for real, 
They don't know just how she feels, 
What a girl, me pretty little thing, oh! 

Stay.... 

I would never repay you for the love you've given to me, 
Me play every day and stay with me for eternity. 
The only thing that we know for sure, me could never ever doubt you, ah. 

Nobody can tell me my baby's not the best, 
She's the best, oh, she's so fresh, what a girl me pretty little thing, oh! 

Stay..... [repeat & fade] 
We be jammin......



All I asked for was your hand
Love was in demand
How was I to understand?

Then you told me how you feel
It was so unreal
Guess it's time for me
To reveal the way I feel

Got a funny feeling that you don't even
Even love me (don't love me)
Got a funny feeling that you don't even, even care.

We assured each other at the start
Forever in our hearts
You and I would never part
Then you...
Got a funny ...
Got a funny ... [repeat ad lib & fade]



Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

You said you'd never ever try to break my heart,
You told a lie, you tore my love apart.
You said you always wanted someone just like me,
You let me down, baby you set me free.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change,
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall in love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Break One

When I heard this crazy stuff about this other guy,
I didn't believe it had to see it with my eyes.
When I saw you and him, you passed me by,
He's not your friend, he's the other guy.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change.
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall on love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Break Two

I'm never gonna fall, 'cause I fell,
Lovin' you for me was like hell.
How could you play me like a champ,
A tramp, a cramp?
Girl you did me worse than a food stamp.
You told me I could trust you,
If I didn't I would crush you.
Never thought that one day I'd bust you,
Walkin' in the sand hand and hand with another man.
I know your game plan and now I understand.
Love is so deep, it's like sleep,
It will leave you blind.
I see how you're livin' so baby next time,
Whatcha gonna do now that the table's are truned around?
I'm livin' swell and now you wanna be down?
Step off, 'cause baby I've learned,
If you're messin' with fire then you're gonna get burned.
You still look dope but a dope I'm not,
I can't get with you 'cause you're too hot.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change.
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall on love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

Never gonna fall,
I'm never gonna fall,
never, never, never

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.


No more games is about positivity

Somebody keep going strong
Somebody said somebody was all a front
Somebody still talking junk

All this negativity by takin a stand
Cos we're five bad brothers from the bean town land
No sell out

We do it our way
Who gives a damn about what critics say
Said we wouldn't last
Said our time will pass
In just a flash
But we're still kicking ass

This card is only one way
To let you know just how I feel

Chorus

Will you be my valentine girl
And I'll give you my heart

All of the flowers I've sent
Could never take the place
Of being there
Although we only just met
You're everything to me

I want you
I want you in my world
Valentine girl

I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me too

The right stuff

The right stuff

First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell 'em when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song

All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you
You made all... my dreams come true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

Your first kiss was a sweet kiss
Second kiss had a twist
Third and your fourth kiss
I don't want to miss
I can see it in your walk
Tell 'em when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song

All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you
You made all... every one of my dreams come true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby.
Girl, you've done me wrong, now you're running back to me.
Thought you were my lady, girl, you drove me crazy,
Now you want the world to see.
(rap:) you must think I'm crazy, please, don't think I'm blind.
Don't wanna dig your line.
Even though I still love you, always thinking of you
(rap:) you better believe I got my pride.
Sooner or later love is gonna get you - sooner or later.
Somehow I know I knew it would get you, love was gonna get you.
(rap:) girl, why you done like this, I know I still love you, check it out.
What'cha gonna do about it, girl, what'cha gonna do? 
You know you done me wrong, I'm still in love with you.
What'cha gonna do about? I can't get you out of my mind.
Every time I see you this happens all the time.

Girl, you made me laugh, girl, you just don't make me cry.
Give me plenty of loving, kissing and a hugging, girl, and that I can't deny.
Sooner or ...
(rap:) listen, I know you still love me, I can see it all over your face,
So what's up? 
What'cha gonna...

What'cha gonna do about it, girl, what'cha gonna do? 
You know you done me wrong, I'm still in love with you.
What'cha gonna do about it, girl, I've got to know
'cause I'm still in love with you.
Girl, you are a star, make me wanna play my guitar.
What'cha gonna do about it? (repeat & fade)


Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

You said you'd never ever try to break my heart,
You told a lie, you tore my love apart.
You said you always wanted someone just like me,
You let me down, baby you set me free.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change,
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall in love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Break One

When I heard this crazy stuff about this other guy,
I didn't believe it had to see it with my eyes.
When I saw you and him, you passed me by,
He's not your friend, he's the other guy.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change.
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall on love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Break Two

I'm never gonna fall, 'cause I fell,
Lovin' you for me was like hell.
How could you play me like a champ,
A tramp, a cramp?
Girl you did me worse than a food stamp.
You told me I could trust you,
If I didn't I would crush you.
Never thought that one day I'd bust you,
Walkin' in the sand hand and hand with another man.
I know your game plan and now I understand.
Love is so deep, it's like sleep,
It will leave you blind.
I see how you're livin' so baby next time,
Whatcha gonna do now that the table's are truned around?
I'm livin' swell and now you wanna be down?
Step off, 'cause baby I've learned,
If you're messin' with fire then you're gonna get burned.
You still look dope but a dope I'm not,
I can't get with you 'cause you're too hot.
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right,
Won't take me through the night.
You told me that you loved me so,
And you'd never let me go.
You played the game you're not the same,
I never thought you'd ever change.
But if it's got to be this way,
I'm never gonna fall on love!

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

Never gonna fall,
I'm never gonna fall,
never, never, never

Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love again,
Never gonna fall in love.

But anyway
It's all about moving on
And striving
And growing up
And learning
Keep keepin on
Yeah
God bless
Cos you see
Uh
The worlds a lot bigger than you and me
You know?



I don't really mean to lead you on
All I wanna do is take you home
You got that flavor

Baby, baby you got the flavor
Baby, baby you got the flavor
You got that flavor

You got it and I want it
You got the flavor and I really need it, girl
Let's not get fakin'
I want you to shake it
Pretty girl I don't really wanna lead you on
I don't wanna lead you on
All I wanna do is take you home
You got that flavor

Let's not get serious
Just straight to business
You're lovin's all I need

My body's aching
Don't feel like waiting baby

Pretty girl I don't really wanna lead you on
I don't really mean to lead you on
All I wanna do is take you home

You got the flavor
I really want it
I really need it
Baby you got that flavor
I don't really mean to lead you on

All I wanna do is take you
Cause you got that flavor

Yo it's Donnie
Call me the playa, ya dig
Like your style, trip with a New Kid
Changed her mind
Backseat in the jeep when I went for mine
I gotta go low real low nice and slow
Can't miss one color in the rainbow
Don't front girl you know what it's all about
Take a chance, turn my taste buds out

I don't really mean to lead you on
I really don't wanna lead you on
All I wanna do is take you home



You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night.
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real.

If you didn't want it you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
You left me sad and lonely, and ran away from home
So since I'm not your only, then go and fetch your bone.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.

I gave you all that I can
Til I caught you swingin'with another man
But this time you strayed too far
Now you come beggin' like the dog you are.

If you didn't want it you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
Don't think that you can play me, and jerk me all around.
You used to be ma baby, now your ass is in the pound.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Oohh, you're a drty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg
Oh, you're so damn dirty.

Yo, yo, why you wanna act like a tramp, a wet food stamp,
I think it's time for me to break camp
Had a crush on my man the first time we met.
Now what you see is what you get
Lost more than a mil on a gambling bet
So here's the Chuckwagon for the dog in you,
Here's the kennelration and the Alpo too

Now you know I didn't want her
She tried to back me on a corner told her
Blow the horn like little Jack Horner
Forever forbidden, the fast girls in life
The fast cars they call'em kittens
They've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over me
I got game for days
Save the sap rap for the handicapped
I've been around the block and I didn't
Fall for the trimmed trap.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.



I like what you know, I like what you show
No doubt about it, I wanna be where you go
I wouldn't change it, or try to explain it
Some guys can be with girls and wind up complainin'
But I wouldn't if I could
I'm not that curious to take a mood swing serious
It's just sauce for the goods
I don't even want to figure it out
I'm too busy thinkin'about you

Girls, where would boys be without girls to love
You know that I'd be with you girls
Where would boys be without girls to love - sweet love

What would I do without someone like you
Without your sexy smile, those ways won't cramp my style
But you made me sweat when you played hard to get
One kiss from your lips though and I forget

That's how you make me feel on the real to real
All I wanna do is be true to you
Don't need the loneliness, to hell with phoniness
I would never leave love out, because I'm all about you, girl

Girls, where would boys be without girls to love
You know that I'd be with you girls
Where would boys be without girls to love - sweet love

Can live with 'em, can live with 'em, can't live without girls

You got me sweatin', can't ya tell?
Without perfume, I love your natural smell
Others won't say that, they like to front
'Cause if they ain't one way, then the girl's a skunk
But you can be yourself, come and chill a while
Do your own thing, it won't cramp my style
And I'll be there, goin' right with the flow
Yeah, I know, and also love the way you show
Your innocent side, your straightup side
Look, we can make you work without the foolish pride
And where would I be without my girl
You know it really doesn't matter, wouldn't trade her for the world

Girls, where would boys be without girls to love
You know that I'd be with you girls
Where would boys be without girls to love - sweet love

I like the things you know, I like the things you show
I wanna be where you go
Makin' me want you, all the things you do
I speak for what I'm into

Girls, where would boys be without girls to love
You know that I'd be with you girls
Where would boys be without girls to love - sweet love




Girl, I just can't live without you 
I know I hurt you 
That's the last thing I meant to do 
Sometimes I can be careless and blind 
Can you forgive the fool that I've been? 

You know I love you 
You're the one thing I have that's true 
My life used to be nothing to me 
I never want to feel that again 

[Chorus: ]
If you go away girl 
You're taking my heart with you 
If you go away girl 
You'll be breaking my heart in two 
If you only stay girl 
I promise you the world 
So please don't ever go away 

You know I need you 
I'm so sorry that I made you cry 
You are everything good in my life 
Your tears have finally opened my eyes 

[Chorus ]
I was so wrong to ever look at another baby 
Even the strongest man can stumble and fall 
And I'll do anything for you 
Anything to be in your arms again 
Baby don't let this be the end 

[Chorus ]
Girl, I just can't live without you 

Never, ever leave me girl 
You promised your love to me forever 
Say you'll never leave me girl [repeat and fade]




Oh, baby, yeah, girl, you always make me feel so good inside
What about you and me?
We were supposed to play for keeps

Home grown from the streets
The jungle in our reach
It ain't about bein' a hood
When you touch me like you should
I'll rule every day
You let me in your world

You see through of these years, our love remains
The moon will never let the tide go away
Through the pleasure and pain
Through the sunshine and rain
Baby, we keep on smilin'
Through the laughter and tears
And all of the years
Baby, we keep on smilin'
Everybody says the same
Baby, keep smilin', smilin' for me, come on now
Baby, keep smilin', keep on smilin'

Headin' out to the beach
Try to claim a few rays
Jump in the back seat
We're gonna taste the grape
Red and white they both go
We're cruisin' the way

That's right, pretty girl
No matter how hard things might get
You can always count on me

Hey, you see... 

Baby keep smilin'...



[Chorus: ]
Close your eyes 
Realize 
It's you and I 
Take my hand 
Understand 
That I'm your man 
If loving you is right I can't go wrong 
Girl, we've known each other for so long 
Chemistry between us has grown strong 
You are the one and only meaning to this song 

God's gift to man is what you are 
You make me feel there's no such thing as too far 
Forever's just enough time to show you girl 
That I'm not acting like I know 
I'll never let you go 

[Chorus ]

I will never let you 
Think that I am someone that I'm not 
You're down for me 
I'm holding on to what I've got 
First impressions work I've always found 
Being with you I know my heart's on solid ground 

People say we can't 
I know we can 
Can't stop it anyway so take my hand 
Let's make this something special 
I want this to grow 
Because of the loyalty you show 
I'll never let you go 

[Chorus ]

For too long I've known 
And far too strong I've grown attached to you 
Just call me your own 
Everywhere people breaking up 
That won't happen to us 
Because we were friends before lovers 

I'll never let you down girl 
Never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go, oh no 

[Rap: ]
It feels good to see your face 
Come have a seat 
Sit by the fireplace and 
I'll massage your shoulders if they hurt 
I can tell by your eyes, a hard day at work 
God's gift to man 
Though some might say that 
We're too young to understand 
But I've got a firm grip on reality 
And you and me is right where I wanna be... 
Wrapped in your arms 
And you in mine 
A love like this is really hard to find 
So I won't front and try to play love games 
I'll always be the same, won't a damn thing change 
You hear me talking? 
Trust what I'm about--love and understanding 
Won't play each other out 
You got a feeling that I'm doing you low? 
Girl it's not so 
I'll never let you go



We gotta work it out
Get back what we lost
I see shadows of a doubt
But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed

She was just turning seventeen
He always promised her he'd stay
They were so love crazy 'til she had a baby
Then he turned and walked away

How long will we keep this goin' on
Before we find a way to care for each other
Living for today
We'll never see tomorrow

We gotta work it out
Get back what we lost
I see shadows of a doubt
But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed

He was just out to get a wreck
He was too proud to show his pain
Someone pulled a trigger
Guess he never figured he would lose at his own game

How long can we keep this goin' on
When no one takes the blame
There's so many gone
We could find a way, it may not be too late

We gotta work it out
Get back what we lost
I see shadows of a doubt
But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed

Take a look around
See how hard it is to survive these days
But sometimes you wonder
How long can this keep goin' on
I guess the only thing you do is keep your fingers crossed

How long will we keep this goin' on
When no one takes the blame
There's so many gone
Livin' for today, we may not see tomorrow

We gotta work it out
Get back what we lost
I see shadows of a doubt
But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed



Keepin' on...keep keepin' on...

Yo, all I wanna do is like swing with you
Is like swing with you, just swing with you, yo baby
All I wanna do is like swing with you, so come on girl and swing
So we can do our thing!
All I wanna do is like swing with you
Is like swing with you, just swing with you, yo baby
All I wanna do is like swing with you, is like swing with you, just swing!

Ooh, ooh, baby
Come on, sugar
Baby, baby, come on

May be a fool to let my heart control me
And my mind is telling me I'm crazy
Is she the one although she hardly knows me
Should I cut her off, for my own safety
Will it last forever?
I don't think so
Will we stay together?
I don't know
My friends say never
Let your heart control you
Is it for the better?
Tell me so

Are you really Mrs. Right
'Cause I can't make up my mind
Girl, you are so fine, so fine
Baby, let me know the deal
'Cause I gotta know if it's for real
Say you will be mine, all mine

Are you really? Are you really? Are you really? Are you really?

Where do I turn, I don't know which way
Will I ever learn from my own mistakes
If I play it smooth, will Mrs. Right swing this way?
Or will it lead to another heartache, baby

Will it last forever?
I don't think so
Will we stay together?
I don't know
My friends say never let your heart control you
Is it for the better?
Tell me so

Are you really Mrs. Right
'Cause I can't make up my mind
Girl, you are so fine, so fine
Baby, let me know the deal
'Cause I gotta know if it's for real
Say you will be mine, all mine

Are you really Mrs. Right
'Cause I can't make up my mind
Girl, you are so fine, so fine
Baby, let me know the deal
'Cause I gotta know if it's for real
Say you will be mine, all mine

(I just can't fight it) I just can't fight it
(The way I feel) The way that I feel about you
(You've got to tell me) Tell me, baby
(Are you for real?) Oh, baby

Are you really Mrs. Right
'Cause I can't make up my mind
Girl, you are so fine, so fine
Baby, let me know the deal
'Cause I gotta know if it's for real
Say you will be mine, all mine

Are you really Mrs. Right
'Cause I can't make up my mind
Girl, you are so fine, so fine
Baby, let me know the deal
'Cause I gotta know if it's for real
Say you will be mine, all mine

Are you really Mrs. Right
'Cause I can't make up my mind
Girl, you are so fine, so fine
Baby, let me know the deal
'Cause I gotta know if it's for real
Say you will be mine, all mine


Time after time 
Everything that I've tried 
Can't do nothing at all 
Everywhere I walk, nowhere to turn 
I was losing my way 
Crying every day 
I was givin' up and you walked into my life 
I never knew anything about love 
In the world that I know 
Lovers come and go 
Nobody anywhere, talk like you do 
Saying dreams can come true 
Then you made me feel just like a man should feel 

[Chorus: ]
Ever since you walked into my life 
All at once, I feel so strong inside 
Anything you ask of me 
I'll do it faithfully 
Since you walked into my life (into my life) 

Yeah, girl 
You're the only one for me 
Oh, girl 

Oh baby (oh baby) 
Now I've got a reason to live 
And oh darling 
How I love the sweet love you give (oh baby) 
And I wanna spend my life with you 
Wanna make your dreams come true 
Every step you take I wanna be with you 

[Chorus ]

I am learning that the touch of love is magic 
Feel it once, and you will see your world so differently 
Nothing stays the way that it was 
Everything begins again 
You're not who you've always been 

[Chorus ]

Ever since you came into my life 
I wanna be with you, girl 

Since you walked into 
Since you walked into my life 
Girl, nothing's ever felt 
Nothing's ever felt so right 
Baby, I wanna be with you 
Since you walked into 
Since you walked into my life 
I wanna be with you 

[Repeat and fade ]



Oh, baby
Think it's time
That you let me come inside your happy home
Show what you what a man like me can do
When you let me get next to you
Baby, come and let me love you all night
Can you imagine what we could do alone?
Turn off the phone, I'll teach you passion
Come inside your happy home

I'll do you right
Oh, baby, please stay
Stay with me forever
Make love every day
We'll be makin' love
Let's do it together

Let's play house
Come and live with me in my dreams
Our secret hideaway
Let's play house
Take a ride, the night has just begun
Let me love you 'til the morning light

When we're together
I love to take off your clothes
Undress you slow
Ooh, it only gets better
When I love you nice and close
To make you feel

Oh, baby, please stay
Stay with me forever
Make love everyday
We'll be makin' love
Let's do it together

Let's play house
Come and live with me in my dreams
Our secret hideaway
Let's play house
Take a ride, the night has just begun
Let me love you 'til the morning light

Oh, baby, please stay
Stay with me forever
Make love everyday
We'll be makin' love
Let's do it together

Let's play house
Come and live with me in my dreams
Our secret hideaway
Let's play house
Take a ride, the night has just begun
Let me love you 'til the morning light




We should talk 
That's what you said to me 
On the beach 
You know the place will be 
So here we sit 
Together in the sand 
I hear you saying 
You hope I'll understand 
The love you used to feel 
You say it's not the same 
When I reach for you 
You just turn away, oh baby 

[Chorus: ]
I can't believe it's over 
I can't believe you're breaking my heart 
I can't believe it's over 
Ooh, baby 
I can't believe it's over 
(I can't believe, I can't believe that you're gone) 
It's over 
(I can't believe it girl) 

Like a wave 
You're drifting out to sea 
What can I do girl 
To bring you back to me 
There must be 
Something I can say (something I can say) 
To change your mind 
To make you want to stay 

Now you're tellin' me 
You found somebody new 
You wanna be with him 
And that he's good to you 
Oh my baby 

[Chorus ]

I watch you walk away 
Disappearing in the dark 
You're not coming back 
And it's tearing me apart 
I said it's tearing me apart 

[Chorus and adlib ]

I can't believe it's over, damn




Oh, baby 
Don't matter for how long life goes on 
I'll Still be loving you, girl 
I know it's real 
This love I feel 
Baby, sure as the skies are blue 
I'll be around 
Won't let you down 
Baby, no one else will do 

Believe in me 
Girl, I'll be your friend 
Together till the end, girl 
(Together till the end, girl) 
Just reach for me 
Girl, I'll be the one 
A lover you can trust 
I'll never give you up 

[Chorus: ]
Till forever's come and gone 
Till the mountains tumble down 
I'll still be loving you, girl 
Till the stars fall from the sky 
Till the seas all run dry 
I'll still be loving you 

When clouds appear 
Now don't you fear 
Baby, we're gonna weather the storm 
I'll stand by you (stand by you) 
We'll see it through 
You'll be safe and warm 

Don't be afraid (Don't be afraid) 
Girl, all through the night (All through the night) 
I'll be there by your side, girl 
(Be there by your side, girl) 
Every way, girl I'll understand 
I'm gonna be your man 
With everything I am 

[Chorus ]

Other lovers are giving up each day, yeah 
But this love of ours is here to stay (yeah, girl) 
I just wanna be with you', girl 
(I just wanna be with you) 
That's all I wanna do 

[Chorus, adlib and fade]




Hey baby 
Hello 
What's on your mind 
I miss you so much 
I miss you too 
But you ain't gotta worry about a thing, 'cause I'll be waitin' for you 

[Chorus: ]
I'll be waitin' for you 
(Till the break of dawn) 
Would you come back to me 
('cause you're better than the rest of them) 
I'll be waitin' for you 
(till the break of dawn) 
Always, always 

I woke up last night 
You're the only one that's on mind 
I can't imagine 
You're not here with me 
With me baby 

I don't know what I would do 
If my love wasn't meant for you 
Girl you make me feel so good inside 
Yes, you do 

[Chorus]

Now my heart begins to break 
Baby, why you so late 
You know that I 
That I do miss you 
Miss you baby 

Now that we found love 
You're all I'm dreaming of 
Girl you make me feel so good inside 
Yes you do 

[Chorus]

I'll be waitin' when you call me 
I'll be here 
Have no fear 
Hurry home 'cause I need you 
I won't deceive you 
I'll never leave you

Spoken:
Jones Beach 1988. Come on!

Do you remember?
Or should I rewind?
To that summer when you caught my eye?
I played it cool
The weather was hot
You had the beauty & the beach on lock.

With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city.

I was like "Hey, girl, can I get your number?"
I remember what you told me too
"Don't call after 10:00"
But you know that I did
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'about you.

I think about you in the Summertime.
Oh oh.
& all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years & I can't deny.
Oh oh.
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the Summertime.
Oh oh.
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
Your my... my Summertime.

Do you remember?
I'll never forget
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet
The water was cool
The feelin' was hot
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked.

In your strapless sundress
Kickin' back, no stress
As long as we was together
'Cause we were feelin' young love
& we couldn't get enough.
Baby, I could reminisce forever.

& now I'm like
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it?
& I wonder if you miss it too?
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now, I'm here & I can't stop thinkin' 'about you.

I think about you in the Summertime.
Oh oh.
& all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years & I can't deny.
Oh oh.
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the Summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
Your my... my Summertime.

Spoken: Break it down.

Summer ended
Winter started
It got colder
When we parted ways...

Spoken: I like this part.

As the seasons change.

Spoken: Bring it forward, bring it back.

Winter melted
Spring I felt it
Summertime will never be the same.
Without you. My Summertime.
My Summertime.

I think about you in the Summertime.
I think about you.
Oh oh.
& all the good times we had, baby.
We had baby.
It's been a few years & I can't deny.
I can't deny.

On my mind.
My Summertime.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah.

'Cause I already got a lady 
Wasn't tryin' to be flirty, wasn't feelin' dirty 
'Til this shorty started runnin' on me.

Didn't have no time to waste, she was lookin' for a taste

I don't want karma 'cause my baby sittin' in bed at home
She know that I be lyin' & see that I be tryin'
To be tryin' to get this shorty with me all alone.

With her pretty lips & her big 'ol hips 
It's gettin' hotter when she touches me with her fingertips 
& her sexy eyes & those big 'ol thighs 
It's gettin' hotter like The Block up in the summertime.

Breakdown: 
Oh, It's so crazy, she's like Baby, I'm like Swayze

But I can shower when I get back home 
'Cause tonight I'm dancing dirty, yeah... [x2]

I see you pulling on up in your car 
And there's something on your mind 
You've been driving around the whole night 
Now you're pulling up next to mine 

I'll lift the hood and look up under 
From the front and to the bumper 
Roll the window up and lock the door 
Cause I'm gonna bring rain and thunder 

Bridge: 
I'll fill you up-up (If you wanna get some) 
I'll pump you up-up (Cause I got the premium) 
I'll fill you up-up, pump you up-up 
'Till the tip-top, drip drop, don't stop, don't stop 

Chorus: 
You ain't gotta do it yourself, baby 
I'm-a give you that full service, you'll see 
You ain't gotta, gotta be nervous, nervous 
I'm-a give you, give you full service, service... 
You ain't even gotta get out of your seat 
I'm-a give you that full service, you'll see 
You ain't gotta, gotta be nervous, nervous 
I'm-a give you, give you full service, service... 

I see you pulling up to the bar 
And there's something on your mind 
Like you've been hanging around the whole night, 
Just sittin' there sippin' on your wine 

I'll pop the cork and fill the glasses 
I'll wipe it up if your drink splashes 
Send the check my way tonight, 
You don't pay, cause I wanna protect your assets 

Bridge 

Chorus 

You ain't gotta, gotta get nervous, nervous 
I'm-a give you, give you full service, service 
You ain't gotta, gotta get nervous, nervous 
I'm-a give you, give you full service, service 

If you could only see, how good it could be 
Anything you need, I'm-a step right up 
And it's on me, ain't no doubt I'm-a work it on out 

If you could only see, how good it could be 
Anything you need, I'm-a step right up 
And it's on me, ain't no doubt I'm-a work it on out 

Chorus 2x  


(Donnie) Hey girl, do you love me? 
(Girl) Yes 
(Donnie) Well, I wanna try something with you. 
So, don't be shy. Are you ready? 
(Girl) Of course, baby 
(Donnie) Let's go 

Chorus: 
You go hit the lights, I'll set up the camera 
Let's get to the action 
You go hit the lights, I'll set up the camera 
Let's get to the action 

I've been thinking about this for some time 
I got a freaky temptation burnin' deep inside 

You say the strip's already rolling 
And the bedroom is the set 
I hope you know your lines 'cause one take is all we get 

Chorus 

By the time this over, girl, I'm-a make you a star 
You ready? (1,2,3,4) 

I'm the directing and producing 
And you're the leading lady of my show 
(You're the leading lady, baby) 
No body double needed, cause I do all the stunts on my own 

Believe that you can turn your phone off 
But be quiet on the set 
You better know your lines 'cause one take is all we get 

Chorus 2x 

We gonna rewind, go one more time 
And playback our love on the wide screen 
Baby, don't stop until I say cut 
Cause our camera's on, keep it rolling, rolling...


Hey, sexy body, keepin' low key, is with nobody 
Chillin' in the spot, so hot 
Fellas walk by ya and they wanna try 
To get up in your face and holler 
Talk about what they got 

Don't they know that you're not the type of 
Girl to take 'em home for one night 
You just came to have a drink 

Chorus: 
Put it on my tab, I'm buying, I'm sending a bottle your way 
Put it on my tab cause you had a long day 
Put it on my tab, I'm buying, I'm sending another your way 
Put it on my tab, keep doing your thing 
Put it on my tab, oh.. 

Hey, pretty lady, lookin' at you, 
I'm thinking maybe I can slide up and talk 
Feel my active, feeling attraction, 
Gotta brother thinking of asking if I could know your name, 
Your age, your sign, what's on your mind 

You might think that I'm the type of cat, 
That wants to hit it tonight 
But I just came to have a drink 

Chorus 

Akon: Hey Mr. Bartender, please make a pina colada 
Hold the alcohol, please 
And whatever baby girl is sippin' on right there, 
You can tell her drink is on me 
'Cause we got money to burn, as if it really grow on trees 
'Cause her beautiful body got me willing to party 
And she got a big hold on me 
She's holding, oh yes, she's holding 
Holding on as much as I'm holding back 
Steady, tryin' to keep her mind on me 
You're the reason why I'm tossing these stacks 
As a matter of fact, tonight the drinks free 

Chorus 3x  


I still get lost, caught in a daze
Tongue tied, just like the very first day... 

I saw you & I'm so amazed 
'Cause the look that got me twisted still hasn't changed.

Your sexy eyes never lie
Baby, I lose myself, when they open
Girl, forget about goin' out 
Baby, I'd rather not. So, I'm hopin'.

Chorus: 
I could just Stare At You forever.
Oh baby.
I could be here with you doin' whatever.
My lady.
It's not the way you look that brings me to my knees
It's the way you look at me 
I could just Stare At You forever 
If forever you were starin' at me.

What do you see? I can't figure it out 
Your talkin' to my heart without makin' a sound 
I can't lose when I'm caught in your eyes 
I feel like superman, Got me up in the sky.

Your sexy eyes never lie 
Baby, I lose my ground...
Your so gorgeous, oh...
Girl, forget about goin' out 
Baby, I want you now... 

Chorus: 
I could just Stare At You forever.
Oh baby.
I could be here with you doin' whatever.
My lady.
It's not the way you look that brings me to my knees
It's the way you look at me 
I could just Stare At You forever 
If forever you were starin' at me.

Baby, keep the lights on 
I'm gonna Stare At You all night long 
& we'll keep rockin' 'til the sun shines 
Waitin' 'til the moonlight to do it again.

Chorus: 
I could just Stare At You forever.
Oh baby.
I could be here with you doin' whatever.
My lady.
It's not the way you look that brings me to my knees
It's the way you look at me 
I could just Stare At You forever 
If forever you were starin' at me.

Oh...
Oh...

She was that girl in the corner
Thick-rimmed glasses
Everybody laughed
Every time she passed us
Ever the outcast
Had no flavor
But who got the last laugh, hey!

Always came last
No one ever kissed her
Missing for days
But nobody missed her
She went from wallpaper to heartbreaker
You should've seen her

(Guitar!)

Baby I like the new you

Oh! I like the remix baby
Oh! I like the remix, remix

Do what you doin' I like the way you do it (hey!)
Do what you doin' I like the way you do it, do it

Now her body’s so crazy
Got mad attention
Everybody wants her
I forgot to mention
My baby’s so intelligent
Down with it
Independent
Got it all

Hey hey hey hey hey hey

See no one ever knew
She was a transformer
Went straight from a two
To an "I just wanna own ya"
I can't help myself
Can't help myself
I need it
Need it

Baby I like the new you

Oh! I like the remix baby
Oh! I like the remix, remix

Oh! I like the remix baby
Oh! I like the remix, remix
Break it down

Do what you doin' I like the way you do it
Do what you doin' I like the way you do it, do it

I like the new you
Forget about the old school
I love the sexy thing you turned into
So gimme the V2
Some of that love fuel
I like the beat that your body moves to, moves to

Do what you doin’ I like the way you do it girl
(I’m speechless, come on)

Oh! I like the remix baby (I like the new you)
(Oh! the one you turned into)

And I'm so thankful girl
I wouldn't have nothing without you
Girl you are my world

'Cause baby you know I love you

'Cause baby you know that I love you
So take my breath
Take my breath
Take my breath away

Take my breath away


I could leave you right now
Pick up the phone and say we're through
Even though we both know
I'll come right back to you
It's a fact I need you
You're the oxygen I breathe
You're running through my veins, under my skin
You're no good for me

I know I gotta give you up
But I just can't let you go
Save my love for another
'Cause it's wasted on you

And even though you drown me
I keep holding on to you
I can't let you go
My love's wasted on you
And even though I'm no fool
I know I'm just passing through
But now I know,
My love's wasted on you

If only I could hate you
I mean I try but I just can't
Or maybe I could find you
In the arms of another man
Even though we both know
It's the beginning to our end
I'm running out of excuses
Lying to myself, keep thinking you can change

I know I gotta give you up
But I just can't let you go
Save my love for another
'Cause it's wasted on you

And even though you drown me
I keep holding on to you
I can't let you go
My love's wasted on you
And even though I'm no fool
I know I'm just passing through
But now I know,
My love's wasted on you

I'm not thinking of you
I'm not broken in two
I'm not looking back
My love's wasted on you
I'm not thinking of you
I'm not broken in two
I'm not looking back
My love's wasted on you
I'm not thinking of you
I'm not broken in two
I'm not looking back
My love's wasted on you
It's all wasted, all wasted,
It's all wasted, all wasted, oho, oho
It's all wasted on you.


Sorry if I’m speaking out of line,
But I don’t want this night to be over,
I don’t want it to end.
Cause it seems like when our worlds collide
It just don’t feel right not to hold you,
It’s getting hard to be friends.

Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get
It’s almost like there’s a force that we can’t resist.

Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What’s happening inside it’s bigger than you and me,
It’s like we’re fighting gravity.
Even if we run we’ll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can’t escape.
It’s gonna pull you back to me.
You’ll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity.

Baby, look up at the universe,
Some things attract to each other,
Like the planets and stars.
Even though I can’t read your mind
You know you think about it all the time,
So what’s keeping us apart?

Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get
It’s almost like there’s a force that we can’t resist.

Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What’s happening inside it’s bigger than you and me,
It’s like we’re fighting gravity.
Even if we run we’ll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can’t escape.
It’s gonna pull you back to me.
You’ll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity.

You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold, like gravity.

Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What’s happening inside it’s bigger than you and me,
It’s like we’re fighting gravity.
Even if we run we’ll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can’t escape.
It’s gonna pull you back to me.
You’ll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity


I finally took your pictures off the wall,
It didn't even help at all,
You're simply too beautiful.

Got you frozen in a frame inside my mind.
How can I forget your smile,
Even for a little while?

They say the time will take this pain away,
Time will heal these scars you made,
Time will give me back my heart again.

Do you even know what you do to me,
How I'm drowning in your memories?
So what to breath, now that you've gone?

Do you know it rips out the heart of me,
Every time I wake up here alone?
How can I move on?

All I do is miss you more, and more.
Everyday I miss you more, and more.

I know that I should walk away and close the door,
But how is that possible
When you're so beautiful?

And the fire in my heart, it burns so bright.
If I don't get you back tonight,
The flames are gonna touch the sky.

They say the time will take this pain away,
Time will heal these scars you made,
Time will give me back my heart again.

Do you even know what you do to me,
How I'm drowning in your memories?
So what to breath, now that you've gone?

Do you know it rips out the heart of me,
Every time I wake up here alone?
How can I move on?

All I do is miss you more, and more.
Everyday I miss you more, and more.

I hate the way I miss you,
I wish that I could kiss you,
But we had crazy issues,
They kept poppin' up like tissues,
One after the next,
Life is so complex,
Used to waitin' for your text,
Now I dread what happens next.

Oh damn, I don't understand,
I thought I was your man,
Now I messed up all the plans.
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't cryin',
Miss you more but I'm tryin'
To miss you less cause I'm dyin'.

You don't even know what you do to me,
How I'm drowning in your memories.
So what to breath, now that you've gone?

You don't know it rips out the heart of me,
Every time I wake up here alone.
How can I move on?

All I do is miss you more, and more.
Everyday I miss you more, and more, and more.

'Cause everyday I miss you more.


I hear a voice, hear a voice that I recognize,
Pulling me closer.
Your every word, every word that I hear tonight
It’s winning me over.

There’s no use running, what we got coming
You don’t have to be afraid.
We’re standing on, standing on, on the edge of grey.

It starts with a whisper, then a heartbeat,
The world is way inside
Till you got me, you’re all I hear tonight.

It’s getting louder and louder
One voice at a time.
Then you softly start to blow my mind.
Can’t stop the whisper, can’t stop the whisper.
The whisper it’s never been so loud.

You hit the note, strike a chord like a symphony
Taking me over.
Cause you’re the one, you’re the one who can light that spark
Blow it all open.

It’s just one reason for what I’m feeling,
I can only hear the truth
Call me now, call me now,
Yeah, it was always you.

It starts with a whisper, then a heartbeat,
The world is way inside
Till you got me, you’re all I hear tonight.

It’s getting louder and louder
One voice at a time.
Then you softly start to blow my mind.
Can’t stop the whisper, the whisper.
Cause we can’t seem to stop, can’t seem to stop,
Cause we’re shouting it out, shouting it out,
Can’t stop the whisper, the whisper
It’s never been so loud, so loud.
It’s never been so loud, so loud.
The whisper, the whisper,
The whisper, the whisper.

Can’t stop the whisper, can’t stop the whisper,
The whisper.
Cause we can’t seem to stop, can’t seem to stop,
Cause we’re shouting it out, shouting it out,
Can’t stop the whisper, the whisper
It’s never been so loud, so loud.
It’s never been so loud, so loud


Your smile, oh, your eyes,
They light up, trouble skies, trouble skies.
Your face, beautiful grace,
Just one look and I'm amazed, I'm amazed.
You came, something changed,
Now my life ain't the same, ain't the same.

But I'm blue.
And sometimes it feels I've been fractured inside.
Baby, I'm jealous, jealous.
Uh, baby, I'm jealous.

No way, there's no way
I can break through this pain, through this pain.
I feel so confused
And my heart feels a fool, feels a fool.

But I'm blue, so blue.
And sometimes it feels I've been fractured inside.
Baby, I'm jealous, jealous.
Uh, baby, I'm jealous.

Can't stop thinking of you, 'cause I'm so jealous, baby
Can't stop feeling so blue, sometimes I'm jealous, baby
Can't stop thinking of you, 'cause I'm so jealous, baby
She's just so careless, baby.

But I'm blue.
And sometimes it feels I've been fractured inside.
Baby, I'm jealous, jealous.
Uh, baby, I'm jealous


These are the days of the times of our lives,
And we're gonna crash into it tonight.
We're gone at the music and our parties collide,
Get ready to blast off,

'Cause we're gonna crash to the moon and the stars in the sky
We're gonna crash into it tonight.
Into the music and out of your mind,
Get ready to blast off, 'cause we're gonna crash.

The way you got me speeding, I don't want to take it slow,
My body's overheating as I feel you getting closer.
My heart is racing, this could be unstoppable,
I can't describe the feeling I be feeling as I crash into you.

You're in my head a lot,
You been trying it all night.
Ignore the stop signs,
Let's go lose control.

These are the days of the times of our lives,
And we're gonna crash into it tonight.
We're gone at the music and our parties collide,
Get ready to blast off,

'Cause we're gonna crash to the moon and the stars in the sky
We're gonna crash into it tonight.
Into the music and out of your mind,
Get ready to blast off, 'cause we're gonna crash.

Don't make me hit the brakes,
Girl, I like the way you drive.
200 miles per hour, let the moment take you over.
Fast lane, get you there in no time,
I can't describe the feeling I'm feeling as I crash into you.

You're in my head a lot,
You been trying it all night.
Ignore the stop signs,
Let's go lose control.

These are the days of the times of our lives,
And we're gonna crash into it tonight.
We're gone at the music and our parties collide,
Get ready to blast off,

'Cause we're gonna crash to the moon and the stars in the sky
We're gonna crash into it tonight.
Into the music and out of your mind,
Get ready to blast off, 'cause we're gonna crash.

'Cause we're gonna crash to the moon and the stars in the sky
We're gonna crash into it tonight.
Into the music and out of your mind,
Get ready to blast off, 'cause we're gonna crash


Another season come and passed,
Yet another role not taken.
Every dream I have and fulfilled,
I wanna scream, but I lost the will.

I take another step somehow
The only things that moves me is you right now.
Give me the strength to get up again.
My story’s not over, this can’t be the end.

Then your love, your love
Makes me believe that I can make things right
I’m coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

How soon we all forget, put it on the line
To live your life in debt.
I tell myself is too late to change
This is insane, I can’t stay the same.

You let me out the dark,
You stopped the bleeding in my heart
Like does it make sense, but you’ll understand
When I need you most you lend me your hand.

And your love, your love
Makes me believe that I can make things right
I’m coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

The weight of the world is lifting
I’m taking a deeper breath,
I’m seeing things a little bit clearer.
I turned in a world when I finally found
The man in the mirror.
How soon we all forget?

Then your love, your love
It makes me believe that I can make things right
I’m coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

I believe in your love.
I’m coming back to life


Light it up in my head like a billboard tile
I want it so bad, so I gotta move fast.
Been stuck in this town, spending too much time,
Feeling sorry for myself, but I’m done with that.

Hit the road, there’s nothing left here but a broken promise.
So let’s go, say goodbye to fear, are you ready to leave?

You’re coming with me, gotta let me know it’s now or never.
I want you with me, but make up your mind, you take forever.
Beautiful thing, I need you right now,
To say that you’re in, cause baby, I’m out.
I want you with me, gotta let me know it’s now or never.

It’s alright, it’s alright.

I can see it in your eyes that you can’t decide
This is not what you know and you’re scared to let go.
I’ve been here your whole life, so it doesn’t feel right
Just to be there all up for us.

Hit the road, there’s nothing left here but a broken promise.
So let’s go, say goodbye to fear, are you ready to leave?

You’re coming with me, gotta let me know it’s now or never.
I want you with me, but make up your mind, you take forever.
Beautiful thing, I need you right now,
To say that you’re in, cause baby, I’m out.
I want you with me, gotta let me know it’s now or never.

It’s alright, it’s alright.

I can see forever you and me together
Nothing could be better, it’s alright.
I can see forever, baby you and me together.
Nothing could be better, it’s alright, cause it’s now or never.

You’re coming with me, gotta let me know it’s now or never.
I want you with me, but make up your mind, you take forever.
Beautiful thing, I need you right now,
To say that you’re in, cause baby, I’m out.
I want you with me, gotta let me know it’s now or never.

It’s alright, it’s alright.
It’s alright, it’s alright.


Now that we've come to an end
You say that you wanna be friends.

Don’t say a word, don’t make a sound,
Don’t keep in touch, don’t come around,
Don’t ask me how I’m doing now,
Don’t think of me, just fade me out.
Forget about me and I’ll forget about you.

I can’t pretend that I don’t love you anymore
I can’t be friends cause it hurts like it’s never hurt before.
Now you think that I’m cold and I don’t care about you,
I’m better without you, couldn't be further from the truth.
Girl, I’m dying, I’m just trying to survive you.

My scars are still burning since you walked away,
Cause you rip them wide open when I see your face.
I’m back at square one trying to breathe through the pain,
You don’t even know what you’re doing to me.
When I get through to life after you?

I can’t pretend that I don’t love you anymore
I can’t be friends cause it hurts like it’s never hurt before.
Now you think that I’m cold and I don’t care about you,
I’m better without you, couldn't be further from the truth.
Girl, I’m dying, I’m just trying to survive you.

Now that we've come to the end
You say that you wanna be friends.
But I,

I can’t pretend that I don’t love you anymore
I can’t be friends cause it hurts like it’s never hurt before.
Now you think that I’m cold and I don’t care about you,
I’m better without you, couldn't be further from the truth.
Girl, I’m dying, I’m just trying to survive you,
I’m just trying to survive you.


We've been all around the world,
It was me and you, done a thing or two.
No matter what lies round there been,
You'll always have my heart.

Gone on like a house on fire,
When all the other things burned out.
We're always taking one step higher
When everybody else went down.
They said we didn't have a chance
They said we'll never make it, now.
Never know what the future holds
All we get is right now.

Let's go out with a bang, let's go out with a bang,
So there's nothing left behind,
We only have tonight.
Let's go out with a bang, let's go out with a bang.

Remember that we're only human, everybody makes mistakes
But there's no use in always being in safe.
Tonight we're gonna go harder, like I never see you again,
Who knows what the future holds, and if this is the end

Let's go out with a bang, let's go out with a bang,
So there's nothing left behind,
We only have tonight.
Let's go out with a bang, let's go out with a bang.

You'll have my heart, no matter what,
There's nothing in this world that can break us up.
This wasn't made with human hands,
It's all part of a bigger plan.
If we keep an open mind, if we dare to look inside
There's no limit to the beauty we can find.

We've been all around the world,
It was me and you, done a thing or two.
No matter what lies round there been,
You'll always have my heart, but before we part

Let's go out with a bang, let's go out with a bang,
So there's nothing left behind,
We only have tonight.
Let's go out with a bang, let's go out with a bang.

You'll have my heart no matter what,
Ain't nothing in this world that can break us up.
You'll have my heart no matter what,
Ain't nothing in this world that can break us up.
You'll have my heart no matter what,
Ain't nothing in this world that can break us up.


I've been away too long without you
Trying to leave it all behind (behind)
But every moment I dream about you
I lose my mind
My love

I don't wanna face another morning
I couldn't make it through another night
If I could only find a way to get back to you
I know that I could make it right

I'm coming home (ooooh oohh)
Girl I feel so lost without you
I'm coming home (ooooh oohh)
Cause I don't know how to deal without you

I would walk for miles
Swim the deepest seas
Til I get there - right where I need to be
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

So tell me how has life been without me
And do I ever cross your mind (do I ever cross your mind)
I promise you will never have to doubt me
No not this time
My love

No I don't wanna face another morning
I couldn't make it through another night
If I could only find a way to get back to you
I know that I could make it right (right, right)

I'm coming home (ooooh oohh)
Girl I feel so lost without you
I'm coming home (ooooh oohh)
Cause I don't know how to deal without you

I would walk for miles
Swim the deepest seas
Til I get there - right where I need to be
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Hey baby please come home
Cause it won't be long
I promise that I'm coming
I'm coming home

Hey baby please come home

Cause it won't be long
I promise that I'm coming
I'm coming home

[Donnie Rap:]
Unlock the door girl
And leave the light on
I wanna get our love on
Don't wanna get our fight on
Stay -
All I wanna do is promise
To honor you
I know I said it last time
But this time
I'm gonna do anything
I can to
Show you my love
Anything I can't do
I'll damn sure try love
Don't wanna blame you
Shame you
Tame you
Girl my only aim is to
Re-last name you
If I hadn't lost you
I never might have loved (nope)
If it hadn't cost me
I might have never grown (yep)
I don't wanna ever spend another night alone

I'm coming
I'm coming home

I would walk for miles
Swim the deepest seas
Til I get there - right where I need to be

I'm coming
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
Cause I don't know how to deal without you
I'm coming home

Baby please come home
Cause it won't be long
I promise that I'm coming
I'm coming home


You walked into my life, your love was so new
And nothing will ever change my feelings for you

Well, you were so far away, now I am close to you, girl
So let us run away, our heart that's waiting will stay

My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl
Don't you know?
My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl

There's so much I like in you, I can't go wrong
I wanted a girl like you, I've looked so long

Girl, nothing will make us wrong, I know our love is too strong
Let's leave the rest behind, our dreams ask what we will find

My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl
Don't you know?
My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl

My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl
Don't you know?
My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl

My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl
Don't you know?
My favorite girl, oh, she's my favorite girl

My favorite girl, she's my favorite girl
Girl, don't you see? You make my heart skip the beat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's my favorite girl
She's my girl, girl



What I tell is a different story
What I have, I take, then give it all away
So if you'd like to come this way
Then help me climb the walls that stand before me

I wanna know
If this is just a game
Can anybody play
Can everybody win
Can you believe it

I may be lost, I may be blind
I may be cursing most of the time
But it's half the fun
And in this world, we spin and shout
We want it all, we want it now
They said, "Oh, shut your mouth
You don't know what you talk about"

I wanna know
If this is just a game
Can anybody play
Can everybody win

Another show, another scene
The city sleeps below, you sing a lullaby
Another show, another scene
And I can't imagine the world without me
I can't imagine the world without me
I can't imagine the world without me, hey
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll, la la la la

I'm on a roll, la la la la
I'm on a roll, la la la la
I'm on a roll, la la la la
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me



Yeah, I'm not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart
So don't ever leave, I don't want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything would go down under

I'll be loving you forever
Just as long as you want me to be
I'll be loving you forever
All this love's for you and me, yeah

(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you
(The things you do)

Yeah, it's forever
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you, yeah

I count the blessings that keep our love new
There's one for me and a million for you
There's just so much that I want to say
But when I look at you all my thoughts get in the way

I'll be loving you forever
Just as long as you want me to be
I'll be loving you forever
All this love's for you and me, yeah

(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you
(The things you do)

Yeah, it's forever
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you, yeah

We've learned to fall to every turn by now
This love will last forever
I can see it all now

(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving you
(The things you do)

Yeah, it's forever
(I'll be loving you)
I'll be
(I'll be loving you)
Loving only you, girl

Oh girl, I'll be loving only you
(I'll be loving you)
(I'll be loving you)
Be loving you, girl



You've been so quiet lately 
Sometimes I wonder has the cat got your tongue 
You seem to be a thousand miles away 
Don't look me in the eyes and say it's O.K. 
Don't lie 
I got this funny feelin' baby 
That it's going to be that time again 
When you have the need for someone else 
I know you better than you know yourself 

(*) Sometimes it takes the strength of a woman 
To understand the weakness of her man 
It's gonna take the strength of this woman 
To keep fightin' for the lovin' of her man 

And darlin' when you've been satisfied 
And it isn't new to you no more 
Think of me, I'll be here alone 
Waitin' for you to find your way back home 

[Repeat (*) ]

Oh I know how hard you tried 
To hide this all from me 
But if you keep a silent heart 
I can't give you what you need 
So hold me close and hold me tight 
Let's say goodnight, and never say goodbye 

[Repeat (*) ]



Jones Beach 1988, come on!

Do you remember, or should I rewind
To that summer when you caught my eye
I played it cool, the weather was hot
You had the beauty and the beach on lock

With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man, when you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city

I was like, "Hey, girl, can I get your number"
I remember what you told me too
"Don't call after ten," but you know that I did
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you

I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy

I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
You're my, my summertime

Do you remember? I'll never forget
Swimming around all soakin' wet
The water was cool, the weather was hot
Looking for Nemo while the ocean rocked

In your strapless sundress, kickin' back, no stress
As long as we was together
'Cause we were feelin' young love, and we couldn't get enough
Baby, I could reminisce forever

And now I'm like, hey, girl, don't you know I miss it
And I wonder if you miss it too
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy

I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
You're my, my summertime

Break it down

Summer ended, winter started
It got colder, when we parted ways
(I like this part)
As the seasons change
(Bring it forward, bring it back)

Winter melted, spring I felt it
Summertime will never be the same
(Without you, my summertime)
My summertime

I think about you in the summertime
I think about you
And all the good times we had, baby

It's been a few years and I can't deny
I can't deny
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy

I think about you in the summertime
(Oh oh)
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
On my mind, my summertime

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh yeah


Two people together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you

Tomorrow forever
We both had these promises for far too long
But now you make the words come true

So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can make me feel this way

[Chorus]
You and me
We are the right combination
For love (for love), we're all we need (oh)
It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key

Can't keep it a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you

You hold me, it's magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do

Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there

[Chorus]

And whenever you call I'm there
Every stairwell to fall I share
I'll be yours till we love I care about you, baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me belong
I'll be by your side forever

[Chorus]



There's not a star in the sky
That could equal to the sparkle in your eyes
This card is only one way
To let you know just how I feel

Chorus

Will you be my valentine girl
And I'll give you my heart
Forever
Be my valentine girl
And I won't let you go
No never

All of the flowers I've sent
Could never take the place
Of being there
Although we only just met
You're everything to me

Chorus

Be my, my valentine girl
I need you
I want you
I want you in my world
Valentine girl

I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me too
Valentine girl

Until fade ...


The right stuff
The right stuff

First time was a great time, second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love, now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk, tell 'em when you talk
I can see it in everything you do, even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby you're the reason why I sing this song
All that I needed was you oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you, you made all my dreams come true

Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh, the right stuff
Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh, the right stuff

Your first kiss was a sweet kiss, second kiss had a twist
Third and your fourth kiss, I don't want to miss
I can see it in your walk, tell 'em when you talk
I can see it in everything you do, even in your thoughts

You got the right stuff, baby, love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby, you're the reason why I sing this song
All that I needed was you in my life, you're so right
And all that I wanted was you
You made all, everyone of my dreams come true

Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh, the right stuff

Treat me right, all night
Makes me feel good, like you should

'''Melanie B:'''
Listen up, I gotta tell ya
About the ins and outs and goings-on
I wouldn't tell just anybody
About the fox that I've been chasing
He's resistant, not persistent
It didn't stop me from homing in
'Cause I'm a choosy not a floozy
I get my hit and then I run with it

We got up and down to it (Oh yeah)
Like the dirty bass in the music
I got my major chords strumming

First bite whet my appetite
Second helping's always better
Started getting burning hot
I found my pride not easy
Slowed it down, I said stop

Cool, sexy, ever ready
Someone fine, always steady
Gentle hands, dirty mind
Use your head and don't be blind
Words of love, they don't wash with me

'''Emma:'''
She used to be my only enemy and never let me free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day, I crossed the line
I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

'''Melanie C and Victoria and Geri:'''
Back then, I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama, I love you, Mama, I care
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
'''Melanie C:'''
You're my friend

'''Melanie B:'''
I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now

Never had a sense of my responsibility

Naivety and childhood left behind
Deprived of the goodness of mankind
past encounters have made her strong
Strong enough to carry on and on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down, no need to care
Lights are low, exposed and bare

(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked)

She knows exactly what to do with men like you
Inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from
Mystery will turn you on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down, no need to care
Lights are low, exposed and bare

(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked)

''Hello? It's me. I thought you'd understand. Well, maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. I keep seeing such a pretty picture. I'd rather be hated than pitied. Maybe I should have left it to your imagination. I just want to be me.''

This angel's dirty face is sore
Holding onto what she had before
Not sharing secrets with any old fool
Now she's gonna keep her cool
She wants to get naked
She wants to get naked

(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked


If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

Now we got the flavour, the bad behaviour
The rhythm, the melody, the juice for you to savour
We're rockin' and vibin' but somebody is jivin'
You need to take a tip, sort it out, get a grip
Whenever I go out, whenever it may be
Never is there a Keanu, but a dweeb lookin' at me
But then even if I did score, he's a loser in the dance floor
Take a deep breath count one, two, three

Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming moves were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove?
Why don't you move?
It's easy, can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Take my hands and dance with me (Dance with me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

''Hey macho, te ví el otro día
Me dio mucha, mucha alegría
Escucha la música, ay madre mía! 
Hey chico, tu no tienes nada
Que susto, que sueco, que polla, que tieso
Oh, no me toques, ay que pero, feo
Venga, venga, marcha salida, toma esa música
Me cantas deprisa, cuidado, cuidado, hey chico
Que loco, toma mi ritmo, me voy contigo
Hey macho te quiero, quiero un hombre, necesito si
Pero no tú, un hombre, hey macho, hey macho
Si no bailas esto no puedes nada conmigo''

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

Can't do nothing for me, baby (Oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa)
Nothing, baby (Oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa)
The rhythm
You can't do nothing for me, baby (Oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa)

Even when his eyes met mine 
His slamming moves were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove?
Why don't you move? (Oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa-whoa whoa)
It's easy, can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Take my hands and dance with me (Dance with me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance

You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool, but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win. you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever?

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do, do do-do
Always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba
Stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna break down
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down, honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money
Don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down, baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much

(Wanna thank you) I need somebody with the human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much) Gotta slow it down, baby

Baby who was the one who treated you so bad
That you felt that you
Had to do to me what she had done to you
Now you prove everything that my friend had
To read about you was true, now it's over and we're through

You thought that you'd play me
And have things your way
So can you blame me
For walking away
What did I do to
Be treated so bad - treated so bad
Now you have lost me
And I was the best thing you'd ever had

CHORUS
Now you think that I don't know what's going on
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
'Cos I know with you I just keep wasting my time

Can't you see
That the things you said and did
Never happened, made believe
That you saw something special inside of me
Now you seem to think
That you can't live your live without me
Sorry baby you can't do this to me

You thoght that you'd play me
And have things your way
So can you blame me
For walking away
What did I do to
Be treated so bad
Now you have lost me
And I was the best thing you'd ever had

CHORUS (repeat)
And you think that I don't know what's going on
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
But I know I just keep wasting my time

Now you know that
I can't live without you
You should see that it's not all about you
This time you played too many games
Now it's time to see
That I won't waste my life no not me

CHORUS (repeat)


'''Emma:'''

You thought that this was love
But my plan, wasn't that for us
I thought that you would understand
I didn't want you for my full time man, yeah yeah

I like the way you made me feel that night
It's something that I can't deny
But I've been hurt before
I can't take it no more
That's why, that's why

You thought that I would be your fool

Don't try to make me believe that you'd never hurt someone
'''Melanie C:'''
Now that pain has come back to you
Thought the love you had was true
And now you don't know what to do, oh

'''Melanie B:'''
Everytime I turn around you're standing right there
I really don't want you and I really don't care
I can't think about you no not forever
What we had was good but there's much more better
You try to blame me, I'll put the blame on you
You play the game baby, I can play the game too
You say you want me back it's a simple fact
Darkchild and all my girls got my back like that, yeah

She used to be my only enemy and never let me free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day, I crossed the line
I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

'''Melanie C and Victoria and Geri:'''
Back then, I didn't know why

'''Melanie C:'''
You're my friend

'''Melanie B:'''
I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now

I had a lot of time to think about
About the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me
'''Emma:'''
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns, but will this never end?
'''Melanie C:'''
Well, my dear, you know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But short-term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me

'''All:'''
Too much of something is bad enough
'''Emma:'''
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
'''All:'''
Too much of nothing is just as tough
'''Emma:'''
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

'''Geri:'''
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
'''Victoria:'''
Something fine, built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
'''Melanie C:'''
Yes, my dear, you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool, but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win. you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever?

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do, do do-do
Always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba
Stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna break down
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down, honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money
Don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down, baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you)
(Wanna thank you) I need somebody with the human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much) Gotta slow it down, baby
(thank you very much) Gotta have some fun

'''Emma:'''
She used to be my only enemy and never let me free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day, I crossed the line
I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

'''Melanie C and Victoria and Geri:'''
Back then, I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

'''All:'''
Mama, I love you, Mama, I care
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
'''Melanie C:'''
You're my friend

'''Melanie B:'''
I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about
About the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

'''Melanie C & Victoria & Geri:'''
Back then, I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

'''Melanie B:'''
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me
'''Emma:'''
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns, but will this never end?
'''Melanie C:'''
Well, my dear, you know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But short-term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me

'''All:'''
Too much of something is bad enough
'''Emma:'''
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
'''All:'''
Too much of nothing is just as tough
'''Emma:'''
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

'''Geri:'''
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
'''Victoria:'''
Something fine, built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
'''Melanie C:'''
Yes, my dear, you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

Too much of something is bad enough ('''Melanie C:''' Bad enough)

Too much of nothing is just as tough ('''Melanie C:''' Just as tough)

What part of no don't you understand? (Understand, understand)
I want a man, not a boy who thinks he can

Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?
Too much of something, we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?


You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool, but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win. you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever?

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do, do do-do
Always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba
Stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna break down
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down, honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money
Don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down, baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you)
(Wanna thank you) I need somebody with the human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much) Gotta slow it down, baby
(thank you very much) Gotta have some fun

'''Melanie B:'''
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me
'''Emma:'''
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns, but will this never end?
'''Melanie C:'''
Well, my dear, you know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But short-term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me

'''All:'''
Too much of something is bad enough
'''Emma:'''
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
'''All:'''
Too much of nothing is just as tough
'''Emma:'''
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

'''Geri:'''
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
'''Victoria:'''
Something fine, built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
'''Melanie C:'''
Yes, my dear, you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

'''All:'''
Too much of something is bad enough ('''Melanie C:''' Bad enough)

Too much of nothing is just as tough ('''Melanie C:''' Just as tough)

What part of no don't you understand? (Understand, understand)
I want a man, not a boy who thinks he can

Too much of nothing, so why don't we give it a try?

You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool, but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win. you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever?

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do, do do-do
Always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba
Stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna break down
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down, honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money
Don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down, baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you)
(Wanna thank you) I need somebody with the human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much) Gotta slow it down, baby
(thank you very much) Gotta have some fun

Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun

Tell me will this déjà vu never end, oh

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring 
This I swear
And all that I want from you 
Is a promise you will be there

If you put two and two together 
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation 
Then I guess I'll have to show you the door

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring 
This I swear
And all that I want from you

'''Melanie B:'''
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me
'''Emma:'''
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns, but will this never end?
'''Melanie C:'''
Well, my dear, you know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But short-term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me

'''All:'''
Too much of something is bad enough
'''Emma:'''
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
'''All:'''
Too much of nothing is just as tough
'''Emma:'''
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

'''Geri:'''
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
'''Victoria:'''
Something fine, built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
'''Melanie C:'''
Yes, my dear, you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

'''All:'''
Too much of something is bad enough ('''Melanie C:''' Bad enough)

Too much of nothing is just as tough ('''Melanie C:''' Just as tough)

What part of no don't you understand? (Understand, understand)
I want a man, not a boy who thinks he can

You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool, but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win. you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever?

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do, do do-do
Always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba
Stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna break down
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see?
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down, honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money
Don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down, baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you)
(Wanna thank you) I need somebody with the human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much) Gotta slow it down, baby
(thank you very much) Gotta have some fun


'''Emma:'''
Do you still remember how we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun

'''All:'''
Hasta mañana
Always be mine 

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

'''Melanie B:'''
Yes, I still remember every whispered word
'''Melanie B and Emma:'''
The touch of your skin, giving life from within like a love song never heard
'''Melanie C:'''
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
'''Melanie C and Emma:'''
Promises made, every memory saved as reflections in my mind

'''All:'''
Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

'''Victoria:'''
Back where I belong now, 
Was it just a dream?
'''Victoria and Emma:'''
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold, 
And the secret's safe with me

'''All:'''
Hasta mañana 
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting ('''Melanie C:''' Viva forever, I'll be waiting)

Listen little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain, love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye my friend 
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end 
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it 
Time will never change it, no no no...

No no no no (You know it's time to say goodbye)
No no no no

The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye my friend 
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)

Give way I'm comin' through 
I'll beep my horn for you 
(Bumper to bumper)

Lookin' for a place to go 
Girls are feelin' risky 
Feelin' kinda frisky 
Come on baby let me know 

Pull over, pull over 
You're driving me reckless 
Over the limit 
Alright, you're gonna get this 

Bumper to bumper, bumper to bumper

Looking but no stoppin' 
Only window shoppin' 
Less you've got some goods to show
Don't tell us that were dirty
Only bein' flirty 
Tops off and down and here we go 

Pull over, pull over,

Over the limit,

There's no place I call the height (ahh-aahh) 
There's no way in a mean street (ahh-aahh) 
There's no happy medium(ahh-aahh) 
There's no in between(ahh-aahh) 
So do your searching, until you're down (ahh-aahh) 
Then realise, you're on you're home ground(ahh-aahh) 

Sittin' in a white room dreaming of a life 
You have got me thinking, what is paradise? 

Should I take an ocean drive, coolin' from the sun 
Silver screen got me thinking this is how it should be done 

Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 

Stand together alone, not knowing who you are 
Friendly strangely, strangely friendly
Would you keep me warm? 

Would you keep me warm? 
You know, you can be your paradise
A heart can keep me warm 
You can have your own dream life
Step into your comfort zone (Emma & Victoria) 
Comfort zone

Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)  
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 

Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong 
I may leave cos I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay (spoken) 

Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong 
I may leave cos I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay (spoken) 

Ain't nobody to take me home 
Cos I'm here, yes where I belong 
I may leave cos I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay 
(Repeat) 

(Spoken in Counterpart)
So it's all just free falling falls 
Huh, out of time 
You've got yours, I've got mine 
Should all this be so precious?
Maybe I should be a little humble? 
Slate to fear, cause I could stumble
So do your searching until you're down 
Cos you're on home ground 

Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
Take me home (ahh-aahh) 
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh) 
(Repeat to Fade)

Can't you see we're all playin' a game 
(Oh-ohh) 

Takin' pride in myself, in the clothes that I wear 
She's only teasin' to make you stare 
She likes to do what the boys do (Emma & Geri) 
Getting dirty on the pitch, chanting with the Kop crew 

But when we got together 
We just come as a one 
Doin' mmm, mmm 
And a-whoa yeah 

One of these girls is doin' their own thing 
One of these girls is just not the same 
I said ah even though we're all doin' our own thing 
Can't you see we're all playin' a game 
(Oh-ohh) 

Pushin' in the clubs, queue jumpin' 
Givin' all the boys a grief 
Givin' lots of cheek and attitude
Keepin' our lovin' brief 

Pushin' in the clubs, queue jumpin' 
Givin' all the boys a grief 
Givin' lots of cheek and attitude
Keepin' our lovin' brief 

You think they've got it? 
Well I've got it 
You've always had it 
No way, they won't get it 
Ah, come on 
Oh! 

But when we got together 
We just come as a one 
Doin' mmm, mmm 
And a-whoa yeah 

One of these girls is doin' their own thing 
One of these girls is just not the same 
I said ah even though we're all doin' our own thing 
Can't you see we're all playin' a game 
(Playin' that, oh, playin' that, oh)


This is definitely my most favourite time of the year,
Oh yeah mine too, yes, I think it is
It is mine yeah, 
I reckon Christmas is all right, cause like the football season is still on. 
And you can watch football on Boxing Day when everyone is being really 
boring and, you're fed up of your presents.
Listen right you can do whatever you want at Christmas as long as it's good, man 
Well what I say this Christmas is just do what you want, 
But make sure you do it like a lady!
If you can't be good, be careful 
(and a ring-ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding)
And make sure you get all your pressies off Santa!

Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling-ring-ting-a-ling-a-ling-ting, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding''
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling you, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding''
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding''

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are we, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 
Let's snuggle up together like birds of a feather would be,
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two,
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding''

Remember to go to sleep on Christmas Eve otherwise Santa (he won't come) 
Or stay up the whole night, 
No! You can't do that 'cause Father Christmas won't come then,
You've gotta go to sleep
Father Christmas doesn't exist now!
Sssssshhhhhh! 
He does Vicki (yes he does) what are you talking about, (you can't say that) Vicki that's terrible to say. 
We know cause we went to Lapland and we saw him, 
I know you might not get what you want but you're gonna get a hit in the
face if you don't shut up! 
If not you'll get a bag of soot 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are we, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding''
Let's snuggle up together like birds of a feather would be, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 
Lets take the road before us and sing a chorus or two, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
''Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding 
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding'' 

HAPPY CHRISTMAS! 

Good Tidings we bring to you and your shwing, 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 


Hey come round and remember

Cause no one wants to be a one hit wonder 
Why can't we work it out? (ah-ah) 
Who called who? I before you? (ah-ah)

Gotta get the feeling back, oh 
Taking each other for granted (harmony) (hey-hey-eh)

Now or never, I hung around forever 
I'm a fly by the seat of my pants girl, see 
I got better thing to do than waste my time looking for you 
It's like this, I'll take you nice and slow 
Unless you don't wanna know then maybe I'll just let you go 

It takes two to get it on and on,
Come round and round

So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa-oh)
So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa, come round)

So baby come round, come round come round
Come around, to my way-hey, I said my way-hey, come round
So baby come round, come round come round
Hey-oh, hey-oh - come round

Ahhh... (Mel B & Emma) relax your mind. 
The spicy girls are here on the planet earth.
Are you too spicy? 
YES! 
(whistling) Aye-yoo!
This song is full of valid information. Information like
(ring) never wee with your knickers on. 
Hold, hold (ring) a minute, that's my phone! (ring) Hello? 
Hello, um, about... I can't believe my... aaahhh
It's um, it's a mad woman. Get lost!
Melanie's always on the phone. 
I'm not always on the phone! I used to be always on the phone
but now I'm not cause I've got ear rot.
And she's always late.
No I'm not, it's my driver, he drives slow. I like this bit. 
(whistling)
(whistling) I've never been any good at whistling. 
You can hum then, not whistle. 
(whistling) 
Uh, hum? eh ha
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
Where's Geri and Mel at this point? 
I think they're asleep. 
I thought it was a bit quiet. 
No, Geri's writin' a poem under a tree somewhere.
No she's hugging that tree. Hug that tree, Geri!
You'd never guess what, you'd never believe this. Alright listen to this. 
Oh... what is it, Geri?
Oooh... what is it? Listen, listen listen. What is it? What is it? 
Friendship often survives the relationship from which it was neglected. 
What? 
Ignoring your conscience allows you to justify everything!
Don't you agree? 
Geri, is you readin' that out of a book? 
Yeah. Ha ha
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la AHHHH!!!!! 
That's what you got to do when you get really stressed, you just
go AHHHH!!!!! 
(clapping) (laughing) 
I should be over there eatin' my sweets, I think.
You're so cute. Ginger! You're just so cute. 
Alright Ginge, how's your... beep! 
No, it's Ginger like Ginger Rogers. It's not like "ginge". 
Well, there's nothing wrong with being ginger. 
There is nothing wrong. I'm out of a bottle anyway. 
ha ha ha (Mel C and Geri)
(humming) Baby, Posh and Ginger and we've got Scary and Sporty! Yeah!
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
Mixed together in a cooking pot, you have the Spice Girls! (Mel B & Geri)
(humming) (Emma, Victoria & Mel B)
Ba, ba, blah
(humming) (Emma & Victoria) 
I want that Indian bit to come again. Where is it? 
Ahh... we are the chosen ones... 
(humming) (Emma & Victoria) 
it didn't last very long, did it?
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
(scatting) Lift your knee up, tap it to the left. Gonna lift
your knee up, tap it to the left. 
That could be a new dance. 
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
Ha, ha. We don't wanna get in trouble now do we? No... I don't
know what you mean by that, though. I... you know... we're not trying to be offensive...
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
Exactly...
Exactly, exactly. 
I quite like that. 
Yeah, I do too

I'm steppin' out into the walk of life
Hold tight the vibe is right
Feel the heat that's in the air
People watchin' everywhere

So we move on to a club
Surround yourself with the feel-good groove
People dancin' everywhere

Swingin' in the dark and heart thumpin'
London Town is thumpin'

Jump the bus and fell hoppin'
London Town is still buzzin'

'''Melanie C:'''
"Bah! Humbug" - no, that's too strong 
'Cause it's my favorite holiday 
But all this year's been a busy blur 
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush 
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from 
Last year, world tour, aeroplanes and babies,
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of '98 passed along those lines 
So deck the halls and trim those trees 
Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer 
I just need to catch my breath 
Christmas with my mates this year 

Calendar picture, frozen landscape 
Chilled this room for twenty-four days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow 
Get this winter over with!
Flashback to springtime, saw him again 
Would've been good to go for a lunch 
Couldn't agree we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch 
We didn't, of course, 'til the summertime 
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him? 
No, this time it was me 
Sunburn in the third degree 
Now the calendar's just one page 
And, of course, I am excited 
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it 

'''All:'''
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

'''Emma:'''
Hardly dashing through the snow 
'Cause I bundled up too tight 
Last minute have-to-do's 
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's R-S-V-P 
No thanks, no party lights 
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax 
Turned down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself 
Same guy called, Halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quiet way, unwind 
Doing Christmas right this time 

'''All:'''
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

'''Emma:'''
Tesco has provided me 
With the world's smallest turkey 
Already in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?
So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow 
To the only all-night garage
But when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year 
"Spending this one alone," he said
"Need a break; this year's been crazy." 
I said, "Me too, but why are you? 
You mean you forgot the papers too?"
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening 
Christmas magic's brought this tale 
To a very happy ending 

'''All:'''
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Now there was a time when they used to say 
That behind every great man
There had to be a great woman

But in these times of change
You know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
Cos there's somethin' we forgot to say to you 

We say
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too
Woman to woman
We're singin' with you

The "inferior sex" has got a new exterior
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too
Everybody take a look around
Can you see, can you see, can you see
There's a woman right next to you

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Oh we ain't makin' stories
No, we ain't makin' plans
Don't ya know that a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man

Now there was a time (there was a time) 
When we used to say (when we used to say) 
That behind every great man 
There has to be a great woman

Well in these times of change 
You know that it is no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
Cos there's somethin' we forgot to say to you 

And that's
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
(Doin it, doin it, do-doin' it, doin' it)
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
(All of my sisters, all of my sisters)
Sisters are doin' it for themselves


We are family
I've got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
I've got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
And we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
All of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

We are family (hey, yeah)
I've got all my sisters with me (sing it to me)
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family (hey, yeah)
I've got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Livin' life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
(High) High hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
No we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do (Emma & Mel C)
You won't go wrong (oh no!) this is our family jewel

We are family (yeah, yeah)
I've got all my sisters with me (sing it to me)
We are family (there you are!)
Get up everybody and sing
We are family (hey, yeah)
I've got all my sisters with me (all my sisters with me)
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family (hey, yeah)
I've got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
I've got all my sisters with me (sing it to me)
We are family
Get up everybody and sing


(The song that Melanie B sang to audition for the Spice Girls. Originally performed by Whitney Houston.) 

I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I will live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity 

(Chorus)
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 

And I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I will live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity 

(Chorus)
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all 

And if by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love


Originally performed by liza minneli in the musical "cabaret"
(victoria's song for which she sang to audition for the spice girls)

You have to understand the way I am, mein herr
A tiger is a tiger, not a lamb, mein herr
You'll never turn the vinegar to jam, mein herr
So I do...
What I do...
When I'm through...
Then I'm through...
And I'm through...
Toodle-oo!
Bye-bye, mein lieber herr
Farewell, mein lieber herr
It was a fine affair
But now it's over
And though I used to care
I need the open air
You're better off without me, mein herr
Don't dab your eye, mein herr
Or wonder why, mein herr
I've always said that I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now


You'd every cause to doubt me, mein herr
The continent of europe is so wide, mein herr
Not only up and down, but side to side, mein herr
I couldn't ever cross it if I tried, mein herr
So I do...
What I can...
Inch by inch...
Step by step...
Mile by mile...
Man by man
Bye-bye, mein lieber herr
Farewell, mein lieber herr
It was a fine affair
But now it's over
And though I used to care
I need the open air
You're better off without me, mein herr
Don't dab your eye, mein herr
Or wonder why, mein herr
I've always said that I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now
You'd every cause to doubt me, mein herr
Auf wiedersehen... bye bye mein herr!


Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream


Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like prayer
No choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer
I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me


Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And venus was her name

She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man a man
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no-one else had
Wa!


She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And venus was her name

She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your venus, I'm your fire
At your desire


Woke up again today before I got to sleep
And the time has come for me, to say whats on my mind
Something is telling me, I wandered in too deep
And the roses came to late to save the vine 

Whatever happens to us
Is gonna happen to us
Baby the feelings gone
We can't go on 

(Chorus)
Can't stay tonight
We're in trouble deep
Can't stay no more
Grass has grown around my feet
And I don't think, I can love you anymore
Can't stay tonight 

You were the world to me, the sun that warmed the sky
But where the roses grow, they cannot stay and die
Look to your heart and see the truth you can't deny
There's nothing left to say, no need to cry 

Whatever happened to us
Was gonna happen to us
Baby the feelings gone
We can't go on 

(Chorus)
Can't stay tonight
We're in trouble deep
Can't stay no more
Grass has grown around my feet
And I don't think, I can love you anymore 

(Chorus)
Can't stay tonight
We're in trouble deep
Can't stay no more
Grass has grown around my feet
And I don't think, I can love you anymore
Can't stay tonight
Can't stay tonight 


Do you, do you think about me?
Do you, do you think about me? 

I see the setting sun, of another passing day
There's been questions on my mind, since you been away
Friend's say that you're doing well, you finally got it made
Outside I share my joy for you, but inside my heart still aches 

It's like a melody, playing endlessly
You're always on my mind
And I wonder all the time 

'''Do you think about me like I think about you?
Do you sometimes stay awake at night? 
Till the morning light? cos you don't know what to do
Do you think about me like I think about you?
And do you toss and turn does your heart still burn?
For the passion we once knew
Do you think about me?'''

Do you, do you think about me? 
Do you, do you think about me? 

I see your face at night, in every dream I dream
Could this be a message, please tell me what it means 
If I had your number, I'd call you on the phone
But your voice wouldn't be enough, it might be better left alone 

It's like I press rewind, it's like the hands of time
They start all over again
Maybe this time, it won't end 

'''Do you think about me like I think about you?
Do you sometimes stay awake at night? 
Till the morning light? cos you don't know what to do
Do you think about me like I think about you?
And do you toss and turn does your heart still burn?
For the passion we once knew
Ooh...'''

I wanna know, oh, do you think about me?
Is there a chance that we could work it all out?
It's been so long obsession and it's so plain to see
That I got what you want, and I've sure got what you need

Do you think about me like I think about you? 
(like I think about baby, all through the night)
Do you think about me like I think about you? 
(do you, do you think about me, oh, oh now baby, eh hey, eh hey)
Do you think about me like I think about you? 
(I've been tossing and turning, my heart is burning)
(don't you need me like I need you? share the passion we once knew)
Do you think about me like I think about you? 


Stay with me tonight
I'll fill you deep inside
And I'll give you something one'd leave for
Just say you'll be with me
for eternity
Baby tell me how you feel
I just need to know

'''(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain, sunshine or is it rain?
(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain... Is this love?'''

Give to me your soul
Just lose your self control
And I take you somewhere that you've never been
Just lay your feelings bare
And tell me that you care
Baby show me what you need
I just need to know

'''(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain, sunshine or is it rain?
(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain... Is this love?'''

Touch me, hold me
Tell me your feelings, then believe

'''(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain, sunshine or is it rain?
(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain, sunshine or is it rain?'''

'''(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain, sunshine or is it rain?
(Is this love?)
Is this joy, is this pain, sunshine or is it rain?'''

(Is this love?)
Now we're together, hold me forever
I'll show you the key to my heart
(Is this love?)
Now we're together, hold me forever
Baby, lets make a start

(Is this love?)
Now we're together, hold me forever
I'll show you the key to my heart
(Is this love?)
Now we're together, hold me forever
Baby, lets make a start


I want you, I need you
Everything about you

I want you, I need you
I want you, I need you

You could be an ocean
Deep enough to swim in
You could be a mountain
Climbing high, reach the sky

You could be a river
Flowing through the depths of my soul
You could be my heaven
Take me to a place where I know

When you touch me, when you go
Deeper still, then I know

I want you, I need you
Everything that you do
I want you, I need you
Everything about you

You could be an island
I would like to drift away
You could be a picture
I would look at every day

When you touch me, when you go
Deeper still, then I know

I want you, I need you
Everything that you do
I want you, I need you
Everything about you

I want you, I need you
Everything that you do
I want you, I need you
Everything about you


Take me away
Take me away ohhh...

I couldn't say how it happened
I couldn't say how the story began
But just like the music you came in time

I couldn't hold you forever
I couldn't change what I feel inside
But why did you come to my life anyway? 

You bring me joy, and ever pain
Like sunshine colored by the rain
Just take my hand,
Baby you can lift me away

Take me away,
I could stay here forever, (ohhh...)
Take me away,
And there's nothing I can do, (ohhh...)
So take me away
Take me away with you...

I (i...) couldn't wait for tommrow,
I (i...) couldn't stand how our love should be,
There's somethings in life
You could never change,

You took my love
Knowing you again
Me sad and bust


I can never leave without you, love
Could only mean nothing to me

Take me away
I could stay here forever
Take me away
And there's nothing I can do, (ohh...)
So take me away
Take me away with you

Forever, forever, forever, sweet baby
Forever, baby, forever (ever), forever,

Take me away
I could stay here forever
Take me away,
And there's nothing I can do, (ohh...)

So take me away, take me away,
Take me away, (with you)
Forever, I could stay here forever
Forever and ever
And there's nothing I can do, (take me away)

Ohh baby, forever, so take me away,
Forever, take me away (ahh....),
Take me away, take me away, with you
Forever, ahh, forever, and ever,
Take me away, please take me
Forever (forever) forever, and ever, and ever
Take me away


(Unreleased Spice Girls song.) 

Everytime I feel your arms around me
I feel the pressure disappear
There's no way that words could ever measure
The kind of pleasure when you're near 

Any time of day or night
Boy you know the feelings right
Bring it on
And you know just what to do
And you know that love takes two
To get it on 

You've got me walking on air
Got me walking on air
You've got me walking on air
Got me walking on air
(You've got me walking on) 

I was tired of being alone without emotion
Your loving potion was the cure
Now i'm sure our love will live forever
We stick together til no more 

All my dreams have been fulfilled
Like a picture standing still
It's your first time, smiled at me
Now the scene has just been set
Boy, you ain't seen nothing yet
Let's get it on

You've got me walking on air
(???, I know what I need tonite)
Got me walking on air
(Round and round let me go, always let me need you know)
You've got me walking on air
(Baby ???, dont let go hold me tight)
Got me walking on air
(Why not take a walk with me, down the road of ecstacy)
(You've got me walking on) 

Every ? I feel tonight
You made me feel like a butterfly
All I wanna do is love you baby 
You're holding me, squeezing me
You're rocking me eternally
All I wanna do is love you baby 

You got me walking 
Boy you got me walking
You got me walking on air
You got me walking
Boy you got me walking
You got me walking on air 

Everytime I feel your arms around me
I feel the pressure disappear
No words can measure the only kind of pleasure
That I feel when you are near
X-rated baby, is what I wanna be
You know me, eternal ecstacy
This won't be a casual affair
You got me walking on air
(You've got me walking on air) 

Got me walking on air (got me walking on air)
You've got me walking on air (walking, walking)
(You got me walking, boy you got me walking)
Got me walking on air (you've got me walking on air)
(You got me walking on air)
You've got me walking on air
(You got me walking, boy you got me walking)
Got me walking on air

You've got me walking on air
(Baby ???, dont let go hold me tight)
Got me walking on air
(Why not take a walk with me, down the road of ecstacy) 

You've got me walking on


Time is now, we want release
Break on through and get the system moving
Get your dreams, and let them loose
Feel the vibe, quick or you'll be losing

You know I, I'm gonna make it baby
Don't you lie, never failed you baby

Now I know, yes I know
I can feel it in my soul
It's telling me which way to go
Believe in me, I will show you

We're gonna make it happen
You know the time is right for us to shine a light
We're gonna make it happen
Don't ask me where I been, just where I'm going to

So hear me out, and let me in
I'm coming through with non-stop motion
Time won't wait, don't hesitate
Visualise your inspiration

You know I, I'm gonna make it baby
Don't you lie, never failed you baby

Come with me, and you'll see
It was meant for you and me
Now that I know we can be free
I want the world to know that

We're gonna make it happen
You know the time is right for us the shine a light
We're gonna make it happen
Don't ask me where I been, just where I'm going to

We're gonna make it happen
You know the time is right for us the shine a light
We're gonna make it happen
Don't ask me where I been, just where I'm going to

Don't go selling the flow
Cos here I go
Coasting, boasting
I'm doing on the mic
There's no stopping me
Moving, grooving
All I wanna do is get through to you
No stopping, delaying
Look at yourself is what I'm saying
This feeling that I got as a matter of fact
Is a natural aphrodisiac

We're gonna make it, make it happen

We're the Spice Girls, yes indeed 
Just girl power is all we need
We know how we got this far 
Strength and courage and a wonderbra 

Could this work with only one? 
Just with me, I'd have no fun 
Would this work with only two? 
We need more for what we do 

Would this work with only three? 
Three's a crowd, bad company
Would this work with only four? 
No way girl, we need one more 

Listen up, take my advice 
We need five for the power of Spice
Give it up!
Give it out! 
Take a stand!
Better shout! 

1-2-3-4-5 Spice Girls!

Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line

Loosen off that pretty french gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh baby don't you hesitate, ah

It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl/boy
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now, nobody

Come on angel my heart's on fire

It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl/boy
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now, nobody, nobody

Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild

Upstairs before the night's too old, yeah

Cause I love you girl/boy
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
Nobody, nobody rod, nobody

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere

Now I believe in looking
Like my time on earth is cooking
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fibre of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect
From your cradle via trousseau
To your death bed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
Because dress has always been my strongest suit

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere

Staying in or hitting townwards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban 
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime
And the few who are invited
To my wardrobe are delighted
As they wander through my things to find en route
That in negligee or formal
I am anything but normal
Because dress has always been my strongest suit

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere

Now you don't need a recital
Of the reasons why it's vital
That tonight my trappings will not be subdued
That from coronet to sandal
No one else is worth a candle
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude
So bring me all my finest
Most audacious, mi divine-ist
Most revealing, most expensive and taboo
Most arresting, most heart-stopping
Most free flowing, most eye popping
Because dress has always been my strongest suit

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere


When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face
If you jump into your bed
And you cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on his way

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singin' and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the storm cloud paints it dark
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way
Now the frosticals appeared 
And they've frozen up my beard
And so we'll lie by the fire
'Till the sleep simply melts them all away

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singin' and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

(One more time everybody!)

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singin' and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

Why don't you give your love, it's Christmas


Are you hangin' up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he drive a red-nose reindeer?
Does he turn up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

'''So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun (it's Christmas!)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun'''

Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
And she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest

'''So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun (it's Christmas!)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun'''

What will your daddy do
When he sees your mommy kissing Santa Claus?
Aah-ah aah-aah

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride around the hillside
In a party you have made
When you land upon your head
And you've been "SPICED!"

'''So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun (it's Christmas!)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun'''

'''So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun (it's Christmas!)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun'''

W-O-M-A-N
W-O-M-A-N

W-O-M-A-N
Be independant like a woman'''

The early years were a lesson
Now we know what's goin' on, we're standing strong on our feet
And now we're industry players
We're wearing G-strings, taking meetings, fitting music to beats

Truly, madly, deeply
Louder baby, louder baby

'''W-O-M-A-N
Can you truly love a woman? (Louder baby, louder baby)
W-O-M-A-N
Be independant like a woman (Madly, deeply, yeah)'''

So happy now (so happy)
Living in a fantasy we built for us today (so very happy now)
So happy now
Being every woman that we wanted to be, louder baby

Well if I could stick my pen in my heart
I would spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy, would it slide on by
Would you think the boy is strange? 
Ain't he strange? 

If I could win ya, if I could sing ya
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried?

Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya,
Would you think the boy's insane?

Do you think that your the only girl around
I guess you think that your the only girl in town

I said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
I said I know it's only rock and roll,
But I like it, I like it, yes I do
But I like it,

Caught in a craze, it's just a faze

Slow it down, read the sign, so you know just where you are going

Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Aaah If you wanna be my lover

Music by elton john
Lyrics by tim rice

In life one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
There's health and fitness, diet and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice

Conversation, wit, I am a doubter
Manners, charm, they're no way to impress
So forget the inner me, observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh

Now I believe in looking like my time on earth is cooking
Whether polka-dotted stripes or even checks
With some glamour guaranteeing every fiber of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effects
From your cradle via trousseau to your death bed you're on view so
Never compromise accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel than conservative apparel
A dress has always been my strongest suit

Staying in or hitting townwards, from the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time
Whether wig or hat or turban, whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime
And the few who are invited to my wardrobe are delighted
As they wander through my things to find en route
That in negligee or formal I am anything but normal
A dress has always been my strongest suit

Now you don't need a recital of the reasons why it's vital
That tonight I simply have to look my best
That from coronet to sandal no one else is worth a candle
That I couldn't make more impact if I'm dressed
So bring me out my finest, most audacious, my divinest
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot
Most arresting, most heart-stopping, most free-flowing, most eye-popping
A dress has always been my strongest suit

The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good as long as you're getting
What's driving you? It's ambition and betting

I said who do you think you are?
(I said who?)
Some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar, you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Playing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong

I said who do you think you are?
(I said who?)
Some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

You have got to reach on up
Never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up
Never lose control

I said who do you think you are?
(I said who?)
Some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
(Who do you think you are?)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
(Who do you think you are?)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
(Who do you think you are?)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
(Who do you think you are?)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
(Who do you think you are?)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
