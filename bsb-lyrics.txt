Long Promised Road
The Beach Boys

So hard to answer future's riddle
When ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle
When the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Sew up the wounds of evolution
And the now starts to get in my way
So what if life's a revelation
If the mind speaks of only today
So real, the pain growing in my soul
Of climbing up to reality's goal

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn
Carries on to the season's ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending

So hard to lift the jeweled sceptre
When the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar
When the taste of life's holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm

So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you

All I Have to Give
Backstreet Boys

I don't know what he does to make you cry,
but I'll be there to make you smile.
I don't have a fancy car,
to get to you I'd walk a thousand miles.
I don't care if he buy you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart? - I don't know...
But if you were my girl...
I'd make it so we'd never be apart.

Chorus:
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you... but
Love is all I have to give.

When you talk - does it seem like he's not
even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away...
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please... I'm on my knees
praying for the day that you'll be mine!!

Chorus

Bridge:
To you...Hey Girl,I don't want you to cry no more - inside
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love
that I have inside ... I Love You baby

Bass break:
And I will give it to you
All I can give,all I can give
Everything I have is for you
But love is all I have to give

Drum break & Chorus 3x and out:
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you ... but
Love is all I have to give...to you.

Anywhere for You
Backstreet Boys

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night you know

Chorus:
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
our love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know is true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know

Chorus

Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oohhh (3x)

Chorus (2x)

As Long as You Love Me
Backstreet Boys

As long as you love me 

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me(I don't know)
Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (you love me)
(repeat to fade)
who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (you love me)

Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from
what did you did
as long as you love me

who you are
where you're from(where you're from)
as long as you love me

who you are as long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
as long as you love me

There'll be no darkness tonight
Hold tight
Let your love light shine bright

Listen to my heart
And lay your body next to mine
Let me fill your soul with all my dreams

Chorus
You're a woman I'm a man
This is more than just a game
I can make you feel so right
Be my lady of the night

You're a woman I'm a man
You're my fortune I'm your fame
These are things we can't disguise
Be my lady of the night

Lay back
Back in my tenderness
And take
Take all of my sweet caress

You've got all of me
It can't go wrong if you agree
Soon two hearts will beat in ecstasy

You're a woman I'm a man
You're my fortune I'm your fame

California Saga: Big Sur
The Beach Boys

Do do do do do do do do do

Cashmere hills filled with evergreens
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea
With the granite cliff
(Big Sur mount)
As a referee
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns
A mother deer with their newborn fawns
All under Big Sur skies
(Big Sur mount)
That's where I belong.

Big Sur I've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers
(Big Sur mount)
And live in canyons covered in springtime green
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And with my old guitar
I'll make up songs to sing.
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water

And so while stars shine brightly from up above
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log.

From time to time I must go away
The thoughts of Big Sur won't let me stay
Away from Big Sur
Oh Big Sur

I Just Wasn't Made for These Times
The Beach Boys

I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside (oh yeah)
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me

Nothing is real this way

You're a part of me now (now)
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't wanna know)

Inside a haze
Between the lines of reason
Hiding from the ghost

Feels like I'm barely breathing

And let it all just wash away
In a downpour

Shades pulled down
I still can't face the sun

But I, I'm goin crazy
I can't stay here
I've gone completely numb
I just wanna need someone

I, I wanna feel the rain again

On my skin
And let it all just wash away

I wanna feel the rain
Feel the rain

Everyone
Backstreet Boys

We've been through days of thunder
Some people said we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together and were millions strong

Let's get on with the show (let's get started)
Turn the lights down low (turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start (you were there)
We know who you are

And this one goes out to

CHORUS

Everyone, yeah, everyone, everyone
So this one goes out to you
Everyone
We're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We took the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around we'll always stay the same, oh yeah

Let's get on with the show (oh, let's get started)
Turn the lights down low (turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start (you were there)
We know who you are
We know who you are

CHORUS - repeat

Now we're minutes away
'Til it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising, they're letting you in
Time for the show to begin

We, we're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you

CHORUS x2

Everything I Own
Boy George

Everything I Own

You sheltered me from harm.
You kept me warm
You kept me warm
And you gave my life to me
You set me free,
You set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.

You taught me how to cry
I don't know why, just don't know why
You told those lies to me
You set me free, set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.
Just to hold you once again.

If there's someone you know,
That wont let you go,
And is taking it all for granted.
You may lose them one day,
Someone takes them away,
And you don't hear a word they say

I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.

Can't Take My Eyes Off You
Boys Town Gang

You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like Heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

Pardon the way that I stare.
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak.
There are no words left to speak,
But if you feel like I feel,
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you, baby,
And if it's quite alright,
I need you, baby,
To warm a lonely night.
I love you, baby.
Trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby,
Don't bring me down, I pray.
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby.
Let me love you.

You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like Heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you, baby,
And if it's quite alright,
I need you, baby,
To warm a lonely night.
I love you, baby.
Trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby,
Don't bring me down, I pray.
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay..

Get Another Boyfriend
Backstreet Boys

Get Another Boyfriend

Backstreet ...check it

Let's talk about one baby
You gotta hear me out
Do you really wanna be the last to know
What it's all about?
Let's talk about two, you say
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know

I'm tellin you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know

Chorus:
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Just another playa', playing in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another Boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done
To become your number one
Was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses that turned you on?
I've seen it before, (don't take) anymore
Three, two you're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

I'm telling you, go get on with your life
Stop acting like you're givin up

CHORUS

"Why?" "Get another Boyfriend"

Hear me out
You must know
What it's all about, baby
That he's just a player in love
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

CHORUS (x2)

Get.....another boyfriend

Root Down
Beastie Boys

I Kick My Root Down
I Put My Root Down

It's Not A Put Down
I Put My Foot Down
And Then I Make Some Love, I Put My Root Down
Like Sweetie Pie By The Stone Alliance
Everbody Knows I'm Known For Dropping Science
I'm Electric Like Dick Hyman
I Guess You'd Expect To Catch The Crew Rhymin'
Never Let You Down With The Stereo Sound
So Mike, Get On The Mic And Turn It Out
We're Talking Root Down, I Put My Root Down
And If You Want To Battle Me, You're Putting Loot Down
I Said Root Down, It's Time To Scoot Down
I'm A Step Up To The Mic In My Goose Down
Come Up Representing From The Upper West
Money Makin' Putting Me To The Test
Sometimes I Feel As Though I've Been Blessed
Because I'm Doing What I Want So I Never Rest
Well, I'm Not Coming Out Goofy Like The Fruit Of The Loom Guys
Just Strutting Like The Meters With The Look-ka Py Py
'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born
but When The Snow Is Falling, Then I'm Gone
You Might Think That I'm A Fanatic
A Phone Call From Utah And I'm Throwing A Panic
But We Kick It From The Root When We Break It On Down
Jimmy Smith Is My Man, I Want To Give Him A Pound

(Chorus)

Ad Rock Don't Stop, Get On The Mic With The Tic And The Toc
I'll Fill You With The Fuckin' Rim Like Brim
I'm Walking Down Your Block And You Say That's Him
There Goes The Guy With The Funky Sound
The Beastie Boys You Know We Come To Get Down
Because I've Got The Flow Where I Grab My Dick
And Say Oh My God, That's The Funky Shit
So I'm Going To Pass The Mic And Cause A Panic
The Original Nasal Kid Is Doing Damage
Every Morning I Took The Train To High Street Station
Doing Homework On The Train, What A Fucked Up situation
On The Way Back Up Hearing Battle Tapes
Through The Underground, Underneath The Sky Scrapes
Like Harlem World Battles On The Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know
Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due
M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You
Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight
"If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright"
It Feels To Play A Little Music
Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It
And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On
A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone
I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom
For Bringing Me Into This World And So On

(Chorus)

She's on It
Beastie Boys

There's no confusion in her conclusion
She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion
Her final decision is perfection and precision
She's grade A class number one in her division
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
She acts like a nag I don't know how it started
Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded
It's gets annoying so high on the tip
If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop
She'll do what's best just to reach the top
She studies real hard all night she'll cram
In school she majors in advanced Def Jam
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
She's cold in the winter and cool like ice
Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice
Her heart starts beatin her hands gets clammy
But she used to be stired up now shes on my jamie
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch
But she won't front cause she's got that itch
She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please
Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it

Hey Ladies
Beastie Boys

Hey...
Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwing
I'm talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing well..
She's talking to the kid to the kid
I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did

Hey ladies *a get funky*
*All the ladies in the house*
*The ladies the ladies*

Well...
Me in the corner with a good looking daughter
I dropped my drawers and said "welcome back Kotter"
We was cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet
In my apartment I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a crab
Educated no stupid yep
And when I say stupid I mean stupid fucked up
I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville then
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records' a number one sound
Just step to the rhythm step step to the ride
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in tune on to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive

Hey ladies *a get funky*
Hey hey hey hey ladies
*Girls girls*
Hey hey hey hey ladies
One more time *ain't it funky now*
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
*Ain't it funky*

You know that..
She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh go and mail that ear
Call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'
Said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went (girls girls girls) insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train well...
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak man
Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning at the one Ton Ho
Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
*She thinks she's the passionate one*

Hey ladies *a get funky*
*What's that*
*Good god*
*Good god* *Damn*
*Good god*
*Baby baby baby baby*
*Is it funky brother*
*Hee ha ha ha*
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Hey hey ladies

As Long as You Love Me
Backstreet Boys

As long as you love me 

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me(I don't know)
Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (you love me)
(repeat to fade)
who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (you love me)

Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from
what did you did
as long as you love me

who you are
where you're from(where you're from)
as long as you love me

who you are as long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)

Walk in the rain
Tryin' to wash away the pain
You went away
I made you cry so many days
Girl: Where two broken hearts gone to?
How can broken hearts find their way back home?
When nobody cares about you, and you're feeling blue
Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting, baby
Come back and stay
Don't say good bye
Don't let my love die
Come back and stay
And try again
Don't walk away
For I'm still your man
Where are you now?
Where did you go?
Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting
I'll miss you so
Walk in the rain
Thinking about the game I play
I am to blame
I lost my lovin' yesterday
Girl: Where two broken hearts gone to?
How can broken hearts find their way back home?
When nobody cares about you, and you're feeling blue
Come back and stay
Don't keep me waiting, baby

Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)
Backstreet Boys

Baby...Ooh...
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could
So bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart

Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (with my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

You know you've gotta stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

I live my life, the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do
Is for you
So what is it that you can't see
Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could
So bad, baby you'd better quit playing games with my heart

Chorus
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (with my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

Quit playing games with my heart

Quit playing games
Baby, baby
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave hangin' here forever
Oh baby, baby this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

5-Piece Chicken Dinner
Beastie Boys

Incomplete
Backstreet Boys

Inconsolable
Backstreet Boys

I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
When I let you walk away tonight
Without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, ohh
If you were here right now, I swear,
I'd tell you this

CHORUS
Baby I don't want to waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me
'Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you (to you)
I'm wishing I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls
I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no.
I've memorised the number
So why can't i make the call
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibilities

CHORUS
Baby I don't wanna waste another day (another day)
Keeping it inside it's killing me
'Cause all I ever want it comes right down to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Oh oh no no no
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
'Cause everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oh oh oh oh can't let go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

CHORUS
'Cause baby I don't wanna waste another day
Keeping it inside it's killing me (killing me 'cause)
'Cause all I ever want (all I ever wanted)
Comes right down to you (to you), to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
Oh oh oh oh

Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
I'm inconsolable
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh
I'm inconsolable
Whoa oh oh oh yeah yeah oh oh
I'm inconsolable
Oh oh yeah yeah

Beastie Boys

Kick it!

You wake up late for school man you don't wanna go
You ask you mom, "Please?" but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk


You gotta fight for your right to party


You pops caught you smoking and he said, "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag Busted!


(repeat chorus)


Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna
wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, "What's that noise?"
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys!

Be True to Your School
The Beach Boys

When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
"Now what's the matter buddy
Ain't you heard of my school
It's number one in the state"

So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl, guys
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school

I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got my decal in back

So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl, guys
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school

Come Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight
================================================================================
Every Time I Close My Eyes
Backstreet Boys

Listen girl, I don't know where to start
Cause every word I say is straight from the heart
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance,
Cause I want you back again

CHORUS:
Cause everytime I close my eyes,I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes do you think about me?
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other
And everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see.

You and I we shared enough together
Each other was all we'd ever need
I thought that you would stay with me forever
But I took for granted the love you gave to me
But I'll keep on trying, till the end
Baby I need you back with me
I need you back,



chorus

And girl I'm going out of my mind
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do
Please say its just a matter of time,
Until I feel your touch,
Until you let me come back to you

RAP:
I think about you girl everytime at night
I'm in love, and it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain
I was just caught up in the lying game
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days
Until you let me come back,
Until you let me start
To find a new way to get back into your heart.

chorus

God Only Knows
The Beach Boys

I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you

When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

CHORUS
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

Root Down
Beastie Boys

I Kick My Root Down
I Put My Root Down

It's Not A Put Down
I Put My Foot Down
And Then I Make Some Love, I Put My Root Down
Like Sweetie Pie By The Stone Alliance
Everbody Knows I'm Known For Dropping Science
I'm Electric Like Dick Hyman
I Guess You'd Expect To Catch The Crew Rhymin'
Never Let You Down With The Stereo Sound
So Mike, Get On The Mic And Turn It Out
We're Talking Root Down, I Put My Root Down
And If You Want To Battle Me, You're Putting Loot Down
I Said Root Down, It's Time To Scoot Down
I'm A Step Up To The Mic In My Goose Down
Come Up Representing From The Upper West
Money Makin' Putting Me To The Test
Sometimes I Feel As Though I've Been Blessed
Because I'm Doing What I Want So I Never Rest
Well, I'm Not Coming Out Goofy Like The Fruit Of The Loom Guys
Just Strutting Like The Meters With The Look-ka Py Py
'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born
but When The Snow Is Falling, Then I'm Gone
You Might Think That I'm A Fanatic
A Phone Call From Utah And I'm Throwing A Panic
But We Kick It From The Root When We Break It On Down
Jimmy Smith Is My Man, I Want To Give Him A Pound

(Chorus)

Ad Rock Don't Stop, Get On The Mic With The Tic And The Toc
I'll Fill You With The Fuckin' Rim Like Brim
I'm Walking Down Your Block And You Say That's Him
There Goes The Guy With The Funky Sound
The Beastie Boys You Know We Come To Get Down
Because I've Got The Flow Where I Grab My Dick
And Say Oh My God, That's The Funky Shit
So I'm Going To Pass The Mic And Cause A Panic
The Original Nasal Kid Is Doing Damage
Every Morning I Took The Train To High Street Station
Doing Homework On The Train, What A Fucked Up situation
On The Way Back Up Hearing Battle Tapes
Through The Underground, Underneath The Sky Scrapes
Like Harlem World Battles On The Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know
Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due
M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You
Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight
"If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright"
It Feels To Play A Little Music
Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It
And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On
A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone
I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom
For Bringing Me Into This World And So On

(Chorus)

Like a Child (Carl Craig remix)

Feels like time we close the room
You're back in town
Guess ya heard the news:
I'll be gone

Turn to cough
Twist my arm
Call the girls
To nurse my charm

Yeah, I'm like a child
I'm like a child

Stay a while
We don't have long
We could talk for hours
Till my strength is gone
Though I get so tired
I still get wired

My pulse is still
When the doctors gone
I think of you and then I know
What went wrong

I'm like a child
I'm like a child

Close the windows in my room
Stay and hold me like you do
I've go the end in sight, yeah.

Like a child
(Yeah ya hold me)

Lose It All
Backstreet Boys

Oh no
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

Don't change a thing, perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

As Long as You Love Me
Backstreet Boys

As long as you love me 

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me(I don't know)
Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (you love me)
(repeat to fade)
who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (you love me)

Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from
what did you did
as long as you love me

who you are
where you're from(where you're from)
as long as you love me

who you are as long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
as long as you love me

Hit and Miss
Pet Shop Boys

If you want to know
why I miss you so
just think back to the first time
we were in love
The night was getting late
I recognised my fate
When you spoke
I awoke
We were in love

Waiting, I'd been waiting so long for this
Waiting, all my life had been hit and miss
I knew in my heart this was only the start of a new life

Your solemn face, your eyes
lit up at this surprise
My heart sped, raced ahead
for we were in love

After that we stayed
together every day
I relaxed with the fact
that we were in love
so in love

Waiting, all my life had been hit and miss
Waiting to experience such a kiss
I knew in my heart this was only the start of a new life

Now if your heart is cold
and I seem too old
just think back to the first time
we were in love
so in love
We were in love
so in love
================================================================================
You're A Woman
Bad Boys Blue

"Tonight
There'll be no darkness tonight
Hold tight
Let your love light shine bright

Listen to my heart
And lay your body next to mine
Let me fill your soul with all my dreams

Chorus
You're a woman I'm a man
This is more than just a game
I can make you feel so right
Be my lady of the night

You're a woman I'm a man
You're my fortune I'm your fame
These are things we can't disguise
Be my lady of the night

Lay back
Back in my tenderness
And take
Take all of my sweet caress

You've got all of me
It can't go wrong if you agree
Soon two hearts will beat in ecstasy

2X
You're a woman I'm a man
You're my fortune I'm your fame
These are things we can't disguise
Be my lady of the night"

There, where the air is free
We'll be (we'll be) what we want to be
Now, if we make a stand
We'll find (we'll find) our promised land!

(I know that) there are many ways
(To live there) in the sun or shade
(Together) we will find the place
(To settle) where there's so much space

(Without rush) And the pace back east
(The hustling) rustling just to feast
(I know I'm) ready to leave too
(So that's why) we are gonna do
(Oh, what we're gonna do is...)

(Go west) life is peaceful there
(Go west) there, in the open air
(Go west) Where the skies are blue
(Go west) This is what we're gonna do...

(Life is peaceful there)
Go west (In the open air)
Go west (Baby, you and me)
(This is our destiny) Come on, come on, come on, come on

(Go west) Sun in winter time
(Go west) we will feel just fine
(Go west) where the skies are blue
(Go west) this is what we're gonna do

(Come on, come on, come on, come on, go west!)

That's Not Me
The Beach Boys

I had to prove that I could make it alone
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me

I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

I'm a little bit scared
Cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love
And I know that I left at the wrong time
My folks when I wrote them
Told 'em what I was up to said that's not me

I went through all kinds of changes
Took a look at myself and said that's not me
I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone I will dream

I once had a dream
So I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready

I once had a dream
So I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty

I once had a dream
So I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty

Well, East Coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

The West Coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian island dolls
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

I wish they all could be California

Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)
Backstreet Boys

Baby...Ooh...
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could
So bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart

Chorus
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (with my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

You know you've gotta stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

I live my life, the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do
Is for you
So what is it that you can't see
Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could
So bad, baby you'd better quit playing games with my heart

Rock and Roll Music
The Beach Boys

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they was blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks a-dancin' got all shook up

They started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old way you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Say if you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
It's gotta be some of that
If you wanna dance with me

Set Adrift on Memory Bliss
Backstreet Boys

Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada dadadadada
(On memory's bliss of you)
Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada (oh) dadadadada

The candle plays the hour glass days go
And all I do is think of you
And wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile, even all the reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my mind

CHORUS:
Baby you send me,
baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me,
Set adrift on memory bliss

Destiny in everything
Reality has replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life
I bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there
Just give me time
To fix my life
baby will you be there when I open my eyes
After all the time I spent wishing

CHORUS

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind fights carelessly imagine
you are happy with your life right now , oh ...
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone
So now I must place you with all the things
That I could never have

Baby you send me, baby you send me,
baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss
Send me, you send me,
Come on now
I know this love is true
I know this love is true

Waiting for a Star to Fall
Boy Meets Girl

I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why

I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

So many people love you baby
That must be what you are

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition

I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

But I can't love you this much baby
And love you from this far

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting
(I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting
(Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
that's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely
Backstreet Boys

Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me...

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only...
Guilty roads to an endless love
(Endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now
Your every wish will be done
They tell me...

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
(Being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Siberia
Backstreet Boys

When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Song for the Man
Beastie Boys

What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down
What makes this world
So sick and evil
I know you don't know

What makes you feel
Like you got miracle whip appeal
Who made you the judge an jury
Ain't you never heard of privacy
What makes this world
So sick and evil
You figure it out

Can't Take My Eyes Off You
Boys Town Gang

You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like Heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

Pardon the way that I stare.
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak.
There are no words left to speak,
But if you feel like I feel,
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you, baby,
And if it's quite alright,
I need you, baby,
To warm a lonely night.
I love you, baby.
Trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby,
Don't bring me down, I pray.
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby.
Let me love you.

You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like Heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you, baby,
And if it's quite alright,
I need you, baby,
To warm a lonely night.
I love you, baby.
Trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby,
Don't bring me down, I pray.
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay..

She's on It
Beastie Boys

There's no confusion in her conclusion
She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion
Her final decision is perfection and precision
She's grade A class number one in her division
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
She acts like a nag I don't know how it started
Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded
It's gets annoying so high on the tip
If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop
She'll do what's best just to reach the top
She studies real hard all night she'll cram
In school she majors in advanced Def Jam
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
She's cold in the winter and cool like ice
Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice
Her heart starts beatin her hands gets clammy
But she used to be stired up now shes on my jamie
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch
But she won't front cause she's got that itch
She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please
Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it
Cuz' she's on it

The Call
Backstreet Boys

(Phone Rings) (Phone Pick-up)
Girl's Voice: Hello
AJ: Hi, it's me. What's up baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight so
don't stay up and wait for me, ok?
Girl's Voice: Where are you?
AJ: Say that again.
Girl's Voice: Hello?
AJ: You're really dropping out, I think my battery must be low.
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to this
place nearby alright, gotta go!"
(Phone Hang-up)

Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
I said hi. I got a little place nearby, wanna go?
I should've said no, someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said...........

CHORUS

Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again, you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied.

CHORUS - repeat

Listen baby, I'm sorry (hello...?)
Listen baby, I'm sorry (hello...?)

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
I said hi, I got a little place nearby, gotta go...........

CHORUS - repeat 2x

Here we go again because it's been awhile
Do me a favor don't touch that dial

Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice

Cruising like a fan boat on the glade

So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage

Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kreme
Kenny Rogers' Gambler is my gambling theme

Always updated and in the know
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
And Norton is chillin' with Mario
Well my name is Adrock I'm a Scorpio
Don't ask me cause I just don't know
I'm known to mop I'm known to glow
But don't get mad cause I gots to go

Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike what cha got to say

Mix Master cut faster

It's all hypnotic and sanctified
I never wanna let a bad day slip by
We be getting stupid in your area
Causing all kinds of hysteria
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry I'll take care of ya
Me and Adam Adam and the Mario C
In the studio it's the place to be
To all party people everywhere be happy and free
With Mix Master Mike we're making history

Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike what you got to say

The Perfect Fan
Backstreet Boys

It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

CHORUS
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

CHORUS - repeat

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would
always be there
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

CHORUS - repeat

'Cause mom you always were,
mom you always were
Mom you always were,
you know you always were'
Cause mom you always were... the perfect fan

I love you mom

Song for the Unloved
Backstreet Boys

Hey..

This one is for the mothers
Who've lost a child
This one is for the gipsys
Who left their hearts behind
This is for the strangers
Sleeping in my heart
Take what they want
And leave while it's still dark

[Bridge]
No one is glamourously
Lonely, all by themselves

[Chorus]
This is a song for the unloved
This is a music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved)

This one's for the bridesmaid


Never the bride
This one's for the dreamers
Who locked their faith inside
This is for the widows
Who think there's only one
The dying fathers that never told their sons

No one is glamourously, lonely
Follow your heart

[Chorus repeat]

Ohh
Tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive

For one last cry
Just one last cry

[Chorus repeat x2]
================================================================================
I Just Wasn't Made for These Times
The Beach Boys

I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You only hold me up like this 'cause you don't know who I really am
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you

We're making out inside crashed cars
We're sleeping through all our memories
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive
(Now I only waste it dreaming of you)

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same

You only hold me up like this 'cause you don't know who I really am
I used to waste my time on waste my time on
Waste my time dreaming of being alive

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase

I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no
I'm not trying, you only hold me up like this

Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness

Like I'll never be the same

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Sugar, We're Goin' Down
Fall Out Boy

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dyin' to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song

And drop a heart and break a name
We're always sleeping in a sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up, how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song

And drop a heart and break a name
We're always sleeping in a sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet

I'll be your number one with a bullet

We're goin' down, down, down, down
We're goin' down, down
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet

Go West
Pet Shop Boys

(Together) We will go our way
(Together) We will leave some day
(Together) Your hand in my hand
(Together) We will make our plan

(Together) We will fly so high
(Together) Tell all our friends goodbye
(Together) We will start life new
(Together) This is what we'll do:

(Go west) Life is peaceful there
(Go west) in the open air
(Go west) where the skies are blue
(Go west) this is what we're gonna do

(Together) We will love the beach
(Together) We will learn and teach
(Together) Change our pace of life
(Together) We will work and strive

(I love you) I know you love me,
(I want you) how could I disagree?
(So that's why) I make no protest
(When you say) you will do the rest

(Go west) life is peaceful there
(Go west) in the open air
(Go west) baby, you and me
(Go west) this is our destiny
(Go west) sun in winter time
(Go west) we will do just fine
(Go west) where the skies are blue
(Go west) this is what we're gonna do

There, where the air is free
We'll be (we'll be) what we want to be
Now, if we make a stand
We'll find (we'll find) our promised land!

(I know that) there are many ways
(To live there) in the sun or shade
(Together) we will find the place
(To settle) where there's so much space

(Without rush) And the pace back east
(The hustling) rustling just to feast
(I know I'm) ready to leave too
(So that's why) we are gonna do
(Oh, what we're gonna do is...)

(Go west) life is peaceful there
(Go west) there, in the open air
(Go west) Where the skies are blue
(Go west) This is what we're gonna do...

(Life is peaceful there)
Go west (In the open air)
Go west (Baby, you and me)
(This is our destiny) Come on, come on, come on, come on

(Go west) Sun in winter time
(Go west) we will feel just fine
(Go west) where the skies are blue
(Go west) this is what we're gonna do

(Come on, come on, come on, come on, go west!)

I Just Wasn't Made for These Times
The Beach Boys

I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
